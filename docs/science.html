<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> Learn the Science</h1>
<p>Living microbes are found everywhere on earth, often in surprising places. Let’s look at some examples to get an idea of how ubiquitous and hardy they can be, and then we’ll back up with a short intro to the science of biology. Finally, we’ll discuss how scientists study the human microbiome.</p>
<div id="microbes-everywhere" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Microbes everywhere</h2>
<p>Virtually all of the life around you is invisible. We tend to forget about things we can’t see, ignoring that which is literally under our noses, but it’s there: living, eating, reproducing lifeforms of incredible tenacity and surprisingly important effects on the world we <em>can</em> see.</p>
<p>Life is tenacious, fighting for and keeping its niche in just about every environment it encounters. In the sky, deep underground, in the most barren habitats cold or hot anywhere on earth, there are lifeforms. The vast majority of these are microbes, so small we can’t see them, but small doesn’t mean irrelevant. In fact, the more that science understands about the invisible microbial world, the more it becomes clear that these uncountably numerous creatures exert a much bigger effect than we think.</p>
<p>Every traditional culture recognizes a role for the invisible, often translated with words like “spirit” or “life force”, sometimes with more expressive terms like “angels”, “demons”, “gods” or even, simply, “God”. Sometimes the more serious people dismiss these invisible forces as so much superstition, as though truth is made only of things we can see, but of course that’s not quite true either. With the right instruments, we <em>can</em> see many invisible things; some of the greatest discoveries happen when a new gadget makes people aware of a world that was previously hidden.</p>
<p>The invisible world of microbes is like that, with new, low-cost technologies showing us incredible, rich, living universes waiting to be explored.</p>
<p>The word “microbe” refers to any tiny organism that carries its own genetic information for purposes of propagating itself. Far too small to see with the naked eye, dozens could fit inside a typical human cell. Although it’s common to think of microbes and bacteria as the same thing, in fact there are at least seven different types of microorganism: bacteria, extremophile life forms called archaea that live and thrive in environments too challenging for bacteria, protozoa, algae, fungi, viruses, and some multi-cellular animal parasites such as helminths. Each of these has its own characteristic body type, means of reproduction, and ways of moving around.</p>
<p>Let’s look next at some of these environments and see the odd places where microbes have been found.</p>
<div id="microbes-above-and-below" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Microbes above and below</h3>
<p>Even the sky contains living microbes. Scientists at the Institut de Chimie de Clermont-Ferrand in France have for decades sampled clouds to determine their precise contents, and sure enough: they finds plenty of life there, usually between 1,000 and 10,000 bacterial cells per milliliter — not all that different from the amount <a href="http://www.livescience.com/26645-microbes-in-the-sky.html">you’d find in alpine snow</a>. Like every living organism, these cells must soak up water and other nutrients, converting them into energy and various by-products, which collectively have a massive effect on the overall atmosphere, more than enough to affect climate.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The upper atmosphere is a harsh place for life: regular freezing and thawing, constant bombardment of UV radiation from the sun during the day, cold, subzero freezing temperatures at night, high speed, unpredictable winds that quickly disperse any colonies. Plus, at any moment these organisms can find themselves flushed to the ground in a rainstorm, where they’ll need to adapt again.</p>
<p>These extreme conditions are just another day in the life for one species commonly found in clouds, <em>Pseudomonas syringae</em>, which harbors a protein in its cellular wall that reacts to cold temperatures, alternately preventing and allowing a water molecule to turn into ice and back. It doesn’t take many of these reactions to generate precipitation. With so many cells constantly floating in the atmosphere, even small changes in concentration — perhaps due to human activity on the ground — can, at least theoretically, make the difference between rainfall and drought. How much of an effect is hard to say: you can imagine how difficult it is to study bacteria floating in the sky.</p>
<p>Our inability to access these environments is often the biggest reason we remain ignorant of the life that is found there, but there have been many attempts to learn more. Formal studies about the viability of microbes in space have been conducted since the early 1960s,<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> when Apollo-era scientists wanted to understand the dangers of space travel, both to any humans in space as well as to those of us on the ground who might be exposed to any intersteller visitors. Although new and bizarre extremophiles are discovered regularly, so far it appears that even the hardiest of known organisms have a tough time when directly exposed to solar ultraviolet radiation. But the particularly resilient spore-making <em>Bacillus subtilis</em>, for example, it is estimated could survive for at least six years if it were shielded somehow from direct sunlight, say embedded inside a meteorite.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Several lichen species, including rock colonizing <em>Rhizocarpon geographicum</em> and <em>Xanthoria elegans</em>, and the vagrant <em>Aspicilia fruticulosa</em>, remained alive after ten days of direct UV exposure on board a European Space Agency spacecraft.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Some especially hardy cyanobacteria that came with the lichens didn’t survive, so perhaps space offers a better chance for multicellular life, which has the luxury of outer protective pigmented layers.</p>
<p>Traces of plankton, for example, have been found in space, on the surface of the International Space Station, where they are believed to have floated from the upper atmosphere.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Why?! How did they get there! Who knows!</p>
<p>What is known is that between a quarter and two-thirds of microbes in the air are entirely new and undiscovered organisms. A study of the “air microbiome” above New York City found bacteria and viruses that apparently originated in water, soil, vegetation, as well as in animals and humans, but even then few patterns emerge. Although there appear to be distinct microbial environments, on the land versus water, for example, overall many of these organisms are quite hardy and seem to find themselves migrating all over the place.</p>
<p>Scientists studying a water-filled fracture two miles underground at the Mponeng gold mine near Johannesburg, South Africa, discovered <em>Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator</em> by accident, after noticing odd levels of hydrogen compounds, by-products of the activity of an isolated bacterial colony.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Interestingly, this organism is a member of the same <em>Firmicutes</em> phylum that dominates human guts, though this particular bacterium evolved quite separately from us: it hasn’t been exposed to surface water for millions of years. A systematic study of its genome revealed that, unlike other bacteria that usually live in co-dependent colonies, this one can survive all by itself, feeding on tiny bits of radioactive energy from uranium decay in an environment far removed from all other energy sources. It’s not a great life: these creatures reproduce rarely, only once every few hundred or thousand years. But at least they don’t have to worry about being consumed by predators down there.</p>
<p>Subglacial Lake Whillans is a lake buried under more than 800 meters of ice in the West Antarctic. <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v512/n7514/full/nature13667.html">A careful underground bore hole</a> inserted by a team from Louisiana State University in 2014 found more than 4,000 different species of bacteria surviving under that ice. The total bacterial count was not that different from what you’d find in surface lakes on other parts of the planet, a fact that is especially surprising for an environment that hasn’t had a ray of light in millions of years. The bacteria instead thrive on iron, sulphur, and nitrogen as energy sources.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Those may not be the deepest examples. A Cold War-era Soviet team drilling the world’s deepest hole, were forced to abandon the project in 1994 at 12,261 meters (or 7.5 miles) underground, when they hit temperatures above 180 °C (or 356 °F), too hot for their equipment. Apparently the conditions weren’t too hot for life, though: the nine-inch diameter Kola Superdeep Borehole<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> found 24 species of fossilized plankton among the two-billion-year-old rocks down there. Of course, fossils are not the same thing as living microbes, but even dead remnants at that depth is evidence of the tenacity of life.</p>
<p>Still other microbes thrive in radioactive environments, like the dangerous interior of a nuclear reactor. <em>Deinococcus radiodurans</em> is an extremophile member of Phylum Deinococcus-Thermus that boasts an impressive built-in DNA repair mechanism that lets it survive cold, vacuum, acid, light, dehydration – you name it. It remains unbothered by radiation levels more than 1,000 times higher than would kill a human.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Microbes around you</h3>
<p>You don’t have to go to extreme conditions to find unusual microbes. Microbes thrive whereever humans live, and they are in our everyday environment too. The recent PathoMap study of DNA collected from the New York City subway found that, like the air above, half of the microbes we walk past everyday are unknown to science.<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Most of the organisms are apparently benign, with no obvious affect on humans one way or another. Even when known pathogens are found, including <em>Yersinia pestis</em> (Bubonic plague) and <em>Bacillus anthracis</em> (anthrax), the lack of reported infections indicates that probably these organisms are busying themselves for some other, unknown, and maybe even useful purpose.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.cell.com/cms/attachment/2054936429/2060898672/gr1.jpg" /><!-- --></p>
<p>Generally the microbes seem content to exist patiently with no apparent affect on the environment. A station flooded by Hurricane Sandy showed a similarity to a marine environment a year after the disaster.</p>
<p>Humans are the source of many unusual microbes in our environment. Regularly shedding 1.5 million skin cells per hour, leftover inhabitants of our bodies can colonize a hotel room in less than six hours.<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<div id="microbes-and-food" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.3</span> Microbes and food</h3>
<p>We like our food pure and clean, and so do microbes. Well, <em>some</em> microbes. Freshly-washed produce is a just a colonization opportunity for many species, for whom the lack of competition is a shot at a fresh start.</p>
<p>Before washing, plants are covered in microbes, from the flowers and branches to the roots. Seeds planted in sterilized soil will germinate, but can’t grow regardless of the nutrients, water, or sunlight you give them. The relationship between soil bacteria and plants is a complicated and understudied one, but what is known is that every plant hosts its own unique species of microbe in a symbiotic relationship as tight as any on earth. The microbes tangled in the roots of a corn or wheat plant, for example, are highly specific to that particular strain. Swap out the microbes, or – worse – sterilize the soil, and the plant can’t take advantage of the nutrients sitting right at hand, because they are in a form that is useless until digested by microbes.</p>
<p>After harvest and processing, our meals still contain a surprising variety of microbes. Of course, sometimes this is deliberate: some of us eat fermented foods like sauerkraut or yogurt to ingest the microbes that were grown to make their special flavor or texture. But even everyday foods, like raw vegetables, will naturally be covered with healthy levels of microbes.</p>
<p>You will ingest somewhere between 1.4 million and 1.3 trillion microbes per day, depending on what type of diet you follow. Eat according to USDA guidelines and you’ll be at the high end of the range, emphasizing fruits and vegetables, lean meat, dairy, and whole grains; the lower end is more typical of a vegan diet, or even a typical American convenience food-style diet of “junk food”. Interestingly, you’ll get roughly the same diversity of microbes no matter which diet you follow, although there can be a difference depending on whether the food is raw or cooked.<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>We eat plants for their nutrients, but what exactly counts as a “nutrient” is often in the eye of the beholder. Plants don’t like to be eaten any more than the rest of us, and they have developed powerful defense mechanisms to keep out predators, including microbes. In fact, it’s those anti-microbial properties that make many plants medicinally useful. One estimate showed that of 18,000 plants available to Native Americans, only 1,625 were used as food; but 2,564 were used as drugs, many of which are specifically there to manipulate microbes.<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Extrapolate that to the estimated 500,000 different plants on earth, only about 1-10% of which are useful as foods to humans, and it becomes clear that microbes play a big role in which plants thrive and which don’t.</p>
<p>You’re not necessarily immune from accidental antibiotic ingestion if you simply avoid eating antibiotic-treated meat. Between 70% - 90% of the antibiotics given to farm animals are ultimately discharged in their manure, which if administered as fertilizer, can coat the soil used for growing food plants. Although antibiotics naturally degrade over time, the process can take months and under many conditions, giving ample time to be taken up in to plants that we eat, so even hard-core vegans may be getting more antibiotics than they like.<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div id="anti-microbials-in-food" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.4</span> Anti-microbials in food</h3>
<p>Even plants that depend on pollinators, or those that spread their seeds by being ingested by birds, don’t necessarily like to be eaten whole and completely. Leafy grasses attract ruminants like cows or sheep with large tasty fibrous leaves that the plant offers in order to bring in the high-nitrogen feces that will help the plants grow better.</p>
<p>See one list of known plant-derived antimicrobials <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88925/table/T1/">here</a>.</p>
<p>One powerful deterrent to insects is the chemical caffeine, produced in abundance by plants in the genus <em>Coffea</em>, including the species <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_arabica"><em>Coffea arabica</em></a>, commonly known as coffee. A powerful toxin against insect invaders, caffeine in the seeds of this plant will kill nearly all invaders. In fact, few insects are known to have any tolerance to caffeine –ensuring that the plant can continue to reproduce unmolested by predators.</p>
<p>But no matter how clever, these self-defense mechanisms aren’t foolproof. One beetle, the coffee berry borer is a notorious bane of Brazilian coffee growers for the way it munches on the coffee beans without any ill effects. When scientists studied this pest, they discovered something missing in the berry borer’s feces: caffeine.<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> How could these bugs eat so much caffeine without becoming poisoned? The reason turned out to be <em>Pseudomonas fulva,</em> a tiny inhabitant of the beetle’s gut, and the only microbe with a gene called ndmA that can metabolize caffeine. Borer beetles without this microbe accumulate large amounts of unmetabolized caffeine and are unable to reproduce.</p>

<div id="microbes-and-health" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Microbes and health</h2>
<p>The great French scientist Louis Pasteur, working as a physician in the 1800s, was the first to popularize the idea that the world is covered in <em>germs</em>, invisible agents that he associated with food spoilage and disease. Simple steps at hygiene, he discovered, could make conditions inhospitable for them, enabling better food storage and dramatically fewer illnesses. Working as a chemistry professor in the 1850s, one of his students, the son of a local wine manufacturer, sought his help to solve problems with souring. Subsequent investigations led him to conclude that invisible yeasts were the culprit, and that exposure to air could affect the rate of fermentation. Pasteur’s emphasis on controlling these microbes led to a general association of germs as pathogens, a bad, even evil force that we must destroy, every single time. The only good germ is a dead germ.</p>
<p>And for good reason. The development of effective disinfectants, and then antibiotics – germ killers –- was one of the greatest medical achievements of all time, saving the lives of a significant fraction of the human race. Before Pasteur, urban life was a precarious game of chance against diseases that seemed to come and go randomly. Thanks to the development of the Germ Theory of Disease, it was suddenly possible to imagine a world where deadly illnesses and infections could be controlled and perhaps eliminated. Now, every day of your life, modern amenities like running water and flush toilets keep you healthy simply by controlling the growth of microbes.</p>
<p>Some can be quite nasty. The bacterium that causes Cholera, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio_cholerae"><em>Vibrio cholerae</em></a>, after infecting the small intestine, promptly hijacks the body’s natural defense systems into sending a large stream of water through the colon to flush out all other bacteria. Normally, this would be an appropriate response to an invasion, but by hiding above the colon, <em>Vibrio cholerae</em> continues to breed above the main flow of water. The resulting diarrhea is so fierce that the patient is literally unable to drink enough to make up for the outflow, and dies of dehydration within days. And in a final act of cruelty, that water that the body pushes out so fiercely is itself full of <em>V. cholerae</em>, who use the opportunity to infect others who come in contact with the water.</p>
<p>Campylobacter jejuni: food poisoning from raw chicken</p>
<p>The toxins produced by the <em>Clostridium</em> genus are among the most dangerous. Botulism (C. <em>Botulinin</em>) Tetanus (C. <em>Tetani)</em>, gangrene (<em>C. perfringens</em>), and of course C. <em>Dificile</em>.</p>
<p>Some bacteria simply use the darkness and wet warmth of the colon as a breeding ground, happily feasting on the materials they find there. They cause trouble not by what they eat, but by what they excrete: nasty toxins that mess up some other part of the body. <em>Clostridium botulinum</em> produces the neurotoxic protein botulinum that can weaken or freeze nerve cells. The most acutely lethal toxin known – only 2 billionths of a gram can kill – botulinum is almost as deadly to people as the plutonium in a nuclear bomb. Just a few pounds under the right conditions would kill everyone on earth.</p>
<p>Part of what makes pathogens so dangerous is it takes so few of them to be deadly. Some <em>Shigella</em> species, for example, become infectious with a starter colony of as few as ten organisms.<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>With such terrible killers lurking out there, it’s tempting to divide all microbes into “bad” (pathogenic), “good” (probiotic) and “neutral” (commensal). You’ll find plenty of lists that do just that.</p>
<p>But often, perhaps usually, the distinction between good and bad is unclear. Consider the “viridans” Streptococci, a group name for a whole breed of related microbes commonly found harmlessly in human mouths. If a few of these escape the mouth and somehow enter the bloodstream, they can land on a heart valve and can cause a dangerous, life-threatening infection. But inside the mouth they are tough competitors to other bacteria that may want a foothold, like the <em>Streptococcus</em> that causes Strep Throat. Mix Viridans with Strep A, and Viridans wins every time. So is it good or bad? Well, it’s bad if your Viridans makes it to the heart; but in its regular form it protects you from other infections.<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Another example, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, found in about a quarter of all Americans, is the agent behind a host of infections ranging from mild skin ailments to the deadly, often untreatable MRSA. But it seems to be harmless when in the presence of Corynebacterium species.<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<div id="gluten" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Gluten</h3>
<p>It’s been well-established that a gluten free diet impacts the microbiome. This shouldn’t be too surprising, given that gluten is a nutrient for some bacteria but not others. But what about people who show an unusual sensitivity, even allergy, to gluten? What’s the cause?</p>
<p>Recently the idea of a gluten free diet has taken on fad diet status. Despite surprisingly little research evidence that it can quantitatively affect health, millions of people swear that gluten gives them various ailments from poor digestion to brain fog. If you don’t believe it, they’ll say, try it yourself and see; and sure enough, many of those who go off gluten claim big health benefits. Eating is usually a zero-sum game: stop eating one thing (say, the gluten in wheat) and you’ll end up eating more of something else (rice or corn). Is it the switch to a different diet — and the anticipation of success that this brings — that makes people feel better, or is there something really significant about gluten itself?</p>
<p>The experts say no, with one important exception. A tiny fraction of people <em>do</em> suffer from Celiac disease, a known disorder of the body’s ability to handle gluten. There are well-established tests that can definitely tell whether you have Celiac disease or not, and although the vast majority of people test negative, those who are true Celiacs will immediately and obviously benefit from a gluten free diet. But what’s driving the difference?</p>
<p>As usual, the genetic evidence isn’t completely lock-tight. Although a third of the population have particular versions of the (DQ2 or DQ8) of a cellular receptor called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA), only a tiny minority go on to develop serious gluten sensitivities. Some studies indicate gluten sensitivity arises at an early age, and that perhaps celiac disease can be prevented by exposing babies to gluten at just the right moment, but other studies say the opposite.<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>These are all clues that the microbiome may be involved, and sure enough, many studies show a definite difference between healthy microbiomes and those with clinically-proven Celiac disease.<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> But because Celiac sufferers tend to eat differently than non-sufferers, it can be hard to tell how much of the microbiome is a result of a different diet, and how much is due to the disorder.</p>
<p>Another clue happens further up the digestive system. Spanish researchers looking at the small intestine found curiously similar microbiomes in both healthy and celiac patients..<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The difference happened at the functional level of what those bacteria <em>do</em>, and not necessarily in just whether the microbe is present or absent. <em>Lactobacillus</em>, it turns out, is one of the best degraders of gluten<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a>, but there are others: <em>Bacillus pumilus</em>, <em>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</em>, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>. Most interestingly, unlike <em>Lactobacillus</em>, some of these bacteria can do more than just digest the gluten: they appear to contain enzymes that transform the gluten — pointing to the possibility that the enzymes produced by these microbes could be purified and used to eliminate traces of gluten from food products.</p>
<p>So if Celiac disease is caused by a change in the way some microbes function, how did that change happen in the first place? One theory is that it’s a virus. Researchers at the University of Chicago and University of Pittsburgh were able to supercharge the way mice react to gluten by infecting them with a reovirus that apparently changes something about the body’s immune response in the presence of the gluten protein.<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Where did this modern plague come from?</p>
<p>The first case to appear in medical journal didn’t happen until 1969 (Golbert), and examples were extremely rare before that. In fact, the very first mention of a food allergy happened about 100 years ago (Schloss).</p>

<p>The most common question I am asked by people who’ve heard about the microbiome: should I take a probiotic? Which one?</p>
<p>The global probiotics market is worth $34 billion, of which at least $6 billion is supplements, according to a May 2016 report by <a href="http://www.bccresearch.com/market-research/food-and-beverage/probiotics-market-ingredients-supplements-foods-report-fod035e.html">BCC Research</a>.</p>
<div id="definition" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Definition</h3>
<p>The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) defines probiotics as “live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host”. Experts reserve the term “probiotic” for supplements, as opposed to foods that happen to contain live, healthy microorganisms, but that distinction is lost on most people, who just want to be sure they consume enough “good” bacteria.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a good time to keep up my regular rant about why I don’t like the term “good” or “bad” when it comes to microbes. Everything depends on context: it’s possible to have too much of a good thing, just as it’s possible to have too little of some bad things. Nature knows how to manage a delicate balance and it’s foolhardy to pretend we know all the consequences of a major change in either direction. Martin Blaser, in his excellent book <em>Missing Microbes</em>, reminds us of the native proverb: “Elk are there to feed the wolves; wolves are there to keep the elk strong.” You may not want to get rid of <em>everything</em>, nor would you want to fill yourself up with too much of anything.</p>

<p>Presumably you’re reading this because you are convinced that microbes have a powerful affect on the body, perhaps as powerful as prescription drugs, yet you wouldn’t consider taking random prescription drugs just to see what happens. The billions of microbes you send into your gut is in a concentration and quantity far greater than anything you’d get from nature. Please remember that.</p>
<p>Here’s an analogy: let’s say scientists discover a breed of parrot that is found in abundance in healthy ecosystems in Costa Rica, so they decide to introduce it to Yellowstone Park. They dump thousands of live parrots all over the park and when they count the overall species diversity the following day, they note with pride that the experiment worked: Yellowstone is now home to a new species, one that is associated with healthy ecosystems! Unfortunately, upon testing again a week later, they learn that the parrots are gone. What happened? You and I can laugh at the idiots who thought they could transplant a tropical species into Wyoming, but maybe that’s exactly what you’re doing if you try to introduce a new species that is not adapted to your microbiome. It may show up in a couple of early gut tests, but if it disappears soon thereafter, was it helpful at all? In the parrot example, it may actually be harmful if it served as food to dangerous predators.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the body is pretty robust and it’s harder to deliberately change the microbiome</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Biology basics</h2>
<p>With all this complexity, how do you begin to study the abundance of life around us? And then, how do we apply what we know about the zillions of organisms <em>around</em> us, to how they relate to what’s <em>inside</em> us?</p>
<p>The methodically classification and analysis of life is the science of biology, and like life itself it is a very broad field. Fortunately, despite the incredible variations, scientists have discovered a few simple traits and rules that apply to every life form. For the special life form <em>homo sapiens</em>, we have also learned a number of simplifications that will let us talk in more detail later.</p>
<div id="the-basics" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.1</span> The Basics</h3>
<p>The study of biology starts with the cell, those tiny self-contained blocks that are the very definition of life. From the most humble microbe to the biggest animal, every living thing is made of these structures, which are really just miniature chemical reactors that pull external molecules from their environment and reassemble them in ways that perpetuate the reaction.</p>
<p>Everything in the universe tends over time to fall into disorganized entropy, but cells contain many tricks, honed over billions of years of evolution, to thrive. Despite the diversity of life, a surprising number of those tricks are shared by all cells: a wall to protect and allow exchanges with the outside world, a means of storing information through DNA, and of course a process of reproduction.</p>
<p>The biggest technical difference among cells is not size or even function, but rather the distinction between two broad categories: eukaryotes, which are the cells of everything from corn plants to humans to fungi and amoebas, and prokaryotes, which are always single-celled bacteria and other microbes. It’s interesting enough that all life could be characterized into these distinct groups, but if you look at the DNA that defines each cell, you will find some other odd differences that hint at more refined relationships among living things.</p>
<p>A cell’s DNA contains all the information needed to create another copy of itself; even the instructions for <em>how to do the copying</em> are just a sequence of predictable DNA letters written somewhere in the genetic code of all cells. This very important copying function is performed by a <em>ribosome</em>, which is a complicated but well-studied part of every living thing. Because the ribosome has such a fundamental function, it tends not to fall prey to many mutations over time; after all, a single DNA letter change in the ribosome is almost always fatal to the entire cell. But every so often — maybe every few million years — there <em>is</em> a mutation in some part of the ribosome, and this leads us to a clever way to understand better how living things are related to one another.</p>
<p>Humans and monkeys, for example, may differ in many different parts of their DNA, but their ribosomes are nearly identical. In fact, the ribosomes of all mammals and even all vertebrates are virtually the same. Well, there <em>are</em> some differences, but interestingly the differences between large, obvious groupings like vertebrates or invertebrates are much more significant than the differences between different vertebrates, or between mammals or other creatures.</p>
<p>In fact we can even quantify the differences, and scientists over the years have done exactly that. The ribosomes of humans and monkeys, for example, are different in only 10 places — practically nothing in a molecule that consists of a few thousand nucleotides connecting dozens of proteins. Similarly, the ribosomes of vertebrates and invertebrates are different in perhaps 100 places – clearly much more significant than the differences within each grouping, but still not terribly different relative to the entire ribosome.</p>
<p>The ribosomes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, on the other hand, can be quite different: perhaps 1000 places (to continue this very-rough-but-sort-of-useful metric). The point is that even at the molecular, ribosome level, we can see obvious genetic differences even if the physical differences between two organisms aren’t necessarily obvious at first glance. A one-celled eurkaryote, like an amoeba or algae, for example, might seem like it should share something in common with a one-celled prokaryote, but looks are entirely deceiving: nobody looking just at the ribosome could possible mistake these as similar.</p>
<p>Now, scientists have mapped the differences in ribosomal structure among nearly all living things and this general rule always applies: the groupings of life forms are directly related to the similarities or differences in their ribosomes. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, scientists have made estimates of how long it takes, given various assumptions, for a series of step-by-step mutations to result in a differently-sized ribosome. In other words, using some basic chemistry that is easily demonstrated experimentally in a lab, we can offer some reasonable guesses for the number of generations it would take for a given level of random mutations to result in the differently-sized ribosomes we see in nature. Add it all up, and behold: you can see a reasonable fit with the clues we have in the fossil record and the geological record for the same creatures.</p>
<p>None of this is perfect, of course, but the point is that we have a crude way to quantify how different one organism is from another and, if you like, we can guess how long it would take for a single common ancestor to accumulate enough random mutations to account for the differences between any two life forms.</p>
<p>So far so good. Next let’s imagine we have a circle, where a single cell begins in the middle, divides into two cells, and those cells divide, etc. for zillions of years until there are clear ribosomal differences between each line. Let’s call this a family tree and take all known life forms and spread them into this circle. </p>
<p>If you do that, you’ll find that the number of mutations necessary to generate all the variation found in eukaryotes – everything from corn plants to people – would take up only a tiny sliver of that circle. The rest of life — in particular the microbial life of prokaryotes – is so unimaginably diverse, that a space alien looking at earth’s lifeforms could well conclude that the differences between humans and corn plants aren’t significant enough to worry about.</p>
<p>That’s how complicated the world of bacteria can be.</p>

<div id="taxonomy" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.2</span> Taxonomy</h3>
<p>How do you talk about the relationships between various different life forms?</p>
<p>A taxon is a simple unit of life. A <em>homo sapiens</em> is a taxon, but so is a primate. A mammal is a taxon too. It might seem odd in the ordinary biological world to bother using the same term ‘taxon’ to refer to all of those units, but for bacteria and anything that reproduces asexually, it’s an important distinction because often, taxonomists don’t agree about whether a group of organisms is part of the same taxon or not.</p>
<p>Since Carl Linnaeus in the 1700’s, the science of taxonomy divides all life into seven major categories: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species (which I was taught in sixth grade to remember by the mnemonic “King Philip Came Over for Girl Scouts”).</p>
<p>Bacteria make up their own kingdom. Just as the animal kingdom includes everything from humans to jellyfish to beetles, the diversity of bacterial life is enormous, a point which can’t be emphasized too much. This is true at every rank in the taxonomy. Even two organisms that are the same at a lower rank, like genus, might have radically different affects on the human body, just as a member of the animal genus Canis could be anything from a wolf or coyote to a Chihuahua.</p>
<p>You cannot mix and match these ranks. If you know something about the number of organisms in one genus, for example, this is meaningful only in comparison to the numbers of another genus. Keep that in mind during our analysis.</p>
<p>Sometimes there are different results, as noted by <span class="citation">(Olesen and Alm <a href="#ref-olesen_dysbiosis_2016">2016</a>)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="microbiology" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.3</span> Microbiology</h3>
<p>All life runs on three chemical building blocks: DNA, RNA, and proteins. Each of these is an arbitrarily-long chain of repeating molecules called <em>nucleotides</em> (DNA or RNA) and <em>amino acids</em> (proteins). Due to constraints on the way atoms interact, the set of building blocks is fixed. All DNA is composed of only four nucleotides: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, represented by the letters ATGC. RNA is composed of the same molecules, except that uracile (U) is substituted for thymine.</p>
<p>Similarly, proteins are constructed with only 20 different amino acids, which can again be represented by a short three-character abbreviation.</p>
<p>The correspondence between these different proteins and combinations of DNA or RNA is referred to as the genetic code.</p>
<p>As a programmer looking through all of this, you may immediately be inspired to write your own software version of this. After all, the remarkable consistency between all of these building blocks cries out for manipulation by computer.</p>
<p>In fact, that’s exactly what bioinformaticians do, and numerous software packages have been developed to make it easy to treat these building blocks of life like ordinary computer strings.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest challenge is the volume of data to be handled, which can easily be measured in gigabytes for a simple organism, but can require entire server farms in the case of some real-world biological systems. For that reason, much of bioinformatics is about optimizations to improve the speed of processing a large data set, or to simply the presentation in a way that can reveal the most biologically interesting aspects of a problem without wading in over-complexity.</p>
<p>One special protein, DNA, can store information.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.4</span> Human Anatomy</h3>
<p>Finally, to round out our overview of how biologists study the microbiome, let’s get specific about aspects of our own human bodies, and break it down into components, each of which as we’ll see play hosts to unique microbial communities.</p>
<div id="mouth" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.6.4.1</span> Mouth</h4>

</div>
<div id="appendix" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.6.4.3</span> Appendix</h4>
<p>Somewhere near the border between the small intestine and the large intestine (colon), there is a small, pinkie-like appendage bulging inconspicuously into the abdominal cavity. For most of the period of modern western medicine, nobody knew its function, other as a source of severe pain when it occasionally exploded in infections that until the development of antibiotics were usually fatal.</p>
<p>Appendicitis used to be very rare (3-4 cases/year till 1890, up to 113 by 1918), which was fortunate, because there was no treatment. It was a sad fact that, for example the only death among the hundred or so frontiersmen and explorers on the Lewis and Clark expedition in the early 1800s was caused by appendicitis — a terrible, painful death in the wilderness but one that would have been just as inevitable at the finest hospitals in the world at the time.</p>
<p>What’s known is that the appendix apparently houses three things: tissue from the immune system, a bunch of what are called IgA antibodies that fight infections, and tons of bacteria. What’s also known is that people who have their appendix removed surgically — usually as a result of one of those terrible infections — recover to live apparently normal lives, with no side effects even decades upon decades later. So what is the appendix doing?</p>
<p>One clue comes from a recent study of 254 patients recovering from a <em>C.</em> <em>Difficil</em> infection, a horridly tenacious bacterium that has gained near-complete resistance to antibiotics and is notoriously difficult to treat. In the study, those with an appendix saw their infections come back 11% of the time, but those with no appendix suffered re-infection rates of 44% — a large and significant difference that has caused most scientists to speculate that the appendix is harboring something that enables the body to recover after a microbial disaster.</p>
<p>My own interest in this subject is not idle curiosity. About fifty years ago, doctors at a small town hospital gave an appendectomy to my five-year-old self in order to treat an unusual belly ache. While doing what was apparently an exploratory surgery to find the cause, they came upon my otherwise healthy-looking appendix and decided on the spot to simply remove it. “Why not?” I’m sure they thought at the time. “If nothing else, it’ll prevent him from appendicitis”, which is as tautologically sound a reason as any.</p>
<p>Did that change me, somehow? Am I fundamentally different because for most of my life I’ve been missing an important microbe safety zone that the rest of you enjoy? Science doesn’t know the answers, and even when there are studies based on well-conducted experiments, I can’t know the answer unless I do the experiment on <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>[Hint: that’s exactly what I did: see Chapter 3]</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.7</span> The technology for studying microbes</h2>
<p>People have been farming the microbes in fermented foods for thousands of years, so when in Pasteur times, scientists first began to cultivate them for experiments, the most obvious way was through the process known as “culturing”. Take a sample containing some microbes of interest, and leave them sit in a hospitable environment long enough for them to reproduce in enough quantity to be useful. That’s still a common way to study microbes, and that couple-of-day incubation period is one reason you don’t get your lab tests back for a few days.</p>
<p>But the techniques for uncovering which organisms are where and what they are doing was revolutionized in the first decade of the 2000s by those new-fangled gene sequencers that were so usefully applied to human genes.</p>
<div id="the-16s-gene" class="section level3">

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.7.2</span> Limitations of 16S</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, despite its low cost and wide use, microbiome studies that focus only on the 16S gene suffer from several inaccuracies compared to other, more expensive methods.</p>
<p><img src="Science/assets/compare16SAccuracySpecies.jpg" /><!-- --></p>
<p>Microbes who share identical 16s sequences can occupy entirely different ecological niches: see: <span class="citation">Jaspers and Overmann (<a href="#ref-jaspers_ecological_2004">2004</a>)</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Now, thanks to new machines originally developed for mass DNA sequencing, the process of finding and understanding microbes has been revolutionized. It’s now possible to search for new life forms <em>without</em> growing them in a culture, and this has made possible a major shift in how to think about life —and what is important and special about human hardware.</p>
<p>Unlike the genetic discoveries you can make by understanding your DNA (from a low-cost consumer service like 23andme), much of the news from the microbial world is <em>actionable</em>. There’s little, if anything, you can do if you find you have a particular type of gene that gives you, say, a propensity to alzheimers for example. But because the microbes around you are constantly changing anyway, and because you can influence which ones grow and which don’t, the world of the human micro biome is eminently <em>actionable</em>.</p>
