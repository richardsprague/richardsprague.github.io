<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 6</span> Go Further</h1>
<p>Once you’ve appreciated the importance of the microbiome and its affect on health and more, you may want to expand your knowledge beyond the scope of this book.</p>
<div id="fermented-food-1" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Fermented Food</h2>
<p>Here are a few things to try:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Fermented and pickled food</li>
<li>Raw milk</li>
</ol>
<p>People have been fermenting food since the distant past, making everything from beer to cheese. Fermentation is an ideal way to preserve food beyond the date at which it is practical to eat.</p>
<p>Fermenting your own foods is surprisingly easy.</p>
<div id="yogurt" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.1</span> Yogurt</h3>
<p>One of the easiest ferments is home-made yogurt. Pour a few cups of whole milk into a saucepan and heat to not-quite-boiling. You’ll need to get it above 160 degrees, the temperature that kills bacteria in milk, but if it goes all the way to boiling the milk will taste scalded. Even that’s not the end of the world, but you may as well try to keep it under that. Use a kitchen thermometer the first few times if you like, but soon you’ll be able to tell intuitively because you’ll see steam rising from the surface of the milk, but no boiling bubbles.</p>
<p>After the milk has been heated, remove and pour it into a glass bowl. Let it sit until it cools to about 110 degrees. Here, a kitchen thermometer is more useful, especially the first time because the exact temperature is more important. Warmer than 110 degrees and the lactobacillus yogurt bacteria will die; too much lower and they won’t grow. Once you have the hang of it, you’ll be able to tell based on the touch: it’ll feel unpleasantly warmer than your hand (which should be 98 degrees) but not too warm to touch. Once the milk hits that rough temperature zone, pour in a tiny amount of yogurt from another source. This is called the “starter” yogurt and the best is to use a bit of leftover from your previous batch, but for your first attempt you can use any commercially-purchased yogurt. Sweetened, flavored, non-fat — any kind is okay as long as it has live cultures in it.</p>
<p>Be sure not to use too much yogurt. Definitely no more than a tablespoon, and perhaps even just a teaspoon or two. Because of the small amounts, you’ll be tempted to think you need more, but in this case more is definitely not better. Too much starter will suffocate the mixture. Whenever I’ve had an unsuccessful batch it’s almost always due to having too much starter.</p>
<p>Mix the starter thoroughly into the lukewarm milk and then cover it up and put it someplace warm. The key is to keep the mixture close to that magical 110 degree point. Some people put it overnight in an oven set to the lowest temperature, but if you don’t like running the oven overnight you can try wrapping it tightly with something that will retain the heat through the night. If have a high-quality thermos-style cooler, you can set it inside there, and some people cover it with thick towels and set it in the warmest part of the house. Another option is to use a heating pad, set to the lowest setting and placed underneath the bowl. The important thing is to keep the mixture at the warm temperatures that the bacteria need in order to breed.</p>
<p>Set in a quiet place for about 8-10 hours. Overnight is ideal. When you open the bowl again, you’ll find the mixture no longer resembles milk, but has been transformed into a much thicker consistency — a yogurt. It will taste sour, and if you’re not accustomed to plain, unsweetened yogurt you may even think that is has spoiled. Nope, that’s just how pure, real yogurt is meant to taste.</p>
</div>
<div id="pickling" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.2</span> Pickling</h3>
<p>The next step after yogurt-making is also easy. It takes a little longer, from one to several weeks, but lets you expand your fermentation skills to many more foods. The most basic one is cabbage, to make your own sauerkraut.</p>
<p>Think of fermentation as a type of farming, only instead of large plants that you see, you’re farming with invisible microbes. In both cases the object is to start with a small seed that grows into a full crop. For sauerkraut, the microbes are naturally occurring on the leaves of plants and vegetables. You just need to put them into the right environment so the microbes can grow. Start with a small head of cabbage and a grater. If you don’t have a grater, then just chop it into small pieces. Cabbage is already covered with tiny microbes, but the interesting ones will not reproduce in the presence of oxygen; you need to get them out of the air. The best way to do that is to submerge them in a liquid — in this case we’ll use the naturally occurring water inside the cabbage leaves themselves. The purpose of grating or chopping is simply to let the water escape from the leaves until it covers the entire mixture.</p>
<p>You’ll need some type of container to submerge the leaves. Best is something made of glass or ceramic, though any container is fine as long as it doesn’t react with the acids that will be produced by the microbes. A standard mason jar works, for example, or even a cleaned-out jar of pasta sauce. Make sure you have a lid for the container, and make sure the lid doesn’t close too tightly. If you use something with a screw-top lid (like a pasta sauce jar) just pop a few tiny holes in the lid. The microbes will be producing carbon dioxide as they ferment, and you’ll need a way for the gases to leave or the container will explode.</p>
<p>Begin packing the cabbage leaves into the container as tightly as possible. While doing this, most people add some salt. The salt serves two purposes; it adds flavor, and it helps draw more water out of the plant. Just a small amount of salt is enough: about what you would use if you were seasoning it for flavor: a few shakes on each cabbage leaf as you peel it is enough, or maybe a total of a tablespoon or two for a small head of cabbage. Continue to pile more leaves into the container until it is full.</p>
<p>If you’re doing everything correctly, there will be a nice layer of liquid that completely covers the leaves in the container. Remember that the microbes can’t reproduce if there is air, so covering with liquid is essential. If you see any green leaves poking out of the liquid, pack them down further. It may help to find an insert of some kind to place directly over the leaves, perhaps anthe lid to a smaller sized jar, one that fits inside the container and lets you squish the leaves even tighter. The key is to keep everything submerged in liquid.</p>
<p>Put as many cabbage leaves as you can into the container and close the lid, but be careful: the bacteria in the jar will soon start to produce carbon dioxide gas, which will put pressure on the container. That’s the reason for the air holes you poked in the lid beforehand. You may want to cover the entire jar with a loose-fitting piece of cellophane, or an old cloth, as a precaution in case the aroma begins to attract insects.</p>
<p>That’s it! Leave the fermenting jar in a cool, undisturbed place and then check on it for the first few days. Make sure the liquid has entirely submerged the cabbage leaves. Within a day or two you’ll also notice some air bubbles in the liquid — the sign that the fermentation has begun to work. Now, just let the jar rest for another several days or more. The longer it sits, the more acidic it will become. If you like a sour taste, let it sit for a week or two, maybe even up to a month or more. If you want a more subtle flavor, take it out in a few days. Feel free to sniff the jar every day or two to decide when you think it’s ready.</p>
<p>When finished, it will look and smell like sauerkraut. If some of the leaves were not entirely submerged in liquid, it’s possible that a layer of moldy fungus has appeared, unsightly but not a problem. Just scrape off whatever doesn’t look like sauerkraut and eat the rest.</p>
</div>
<div id="whats-happening-in-sauerkraut" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.3</span> What’s happening in sauerkraut</h3>
<p>The transformation from cabbage leaves to sauerkraut happens thanks to a complex interaction of bacteria starting with some members of the Leuconostoc species that occur naturally on the cabbage leaves. These are anaerobic organisms — they can’t live in oxygen. When submerged in the cabbage liquid, however, they thrive, consuming all the sugars they can find and converting them to lactic acid, giving off carbon dioxide as a byproduct. You’ll know the reaction is occurring when you spot tiny bubbles at the surface of the liquid a few hours after beginning the reaction.</p>
<p>Sadly for the Leuconostoc, they are too good at what they do. Eventually they’ll consume all of the sugars they find transforming the liquid into a sour concoction, and as result the environment turns too acidic for them and they die.</p>
<p>By then, the conditions have become ideal for another species, lactobacillus, which was pretty much designed for acidic liquids, and they finish off the remaining sugars, until the acidic level reaches PH=3, at which point their work is done. Fortunately for humans, the pathogens that could cause us harm are unable to survive in this high-acidic environment, and would be out-competed by the existing microbes anyway, so the final mixture is perfectly healthy.</p>
</div>
<div id="more-fermentation" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.4</span> More fermentation</h3>
<p>Just about any food can be fermented, as people in all cultures have known since pre-history. Many common ethnic foods, such as miso (soybean) or kimchee (cabbage), are possible only thanks to fermentation. When you eat “cured” bacon or sausage, you are eating something that resulted from a complex interaction between microbes and meat.</p>

<p>The number of books about the microbiome have exploded in the past few years, but I’ve tried to read (or at least skim) every book I can find. If you’re a newcomer who would like to come up to speed, here’s my ranked list of the best books as of today (November 2016).</p>

</div>
<p>At only 120 pages, this is the most concise summary of what’s known — and not known — about the microbiome. Written by one of the scientists behind the American Gut Project, it’s a readable and fascinating overview of the facts and a great first introduction. If you only read one book, this is it.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51rHLpBNX2L._SL160_.jpg" />

</div>
<p>Another concise, well-written summary by a top-notch researcher. This one ties for first place because, well, I’m a fan of uBiome and this one doesn’t focus on American Gut. The science is first-rate, but there is practical advice too, including an appendix of microbiome-friendly recipes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spector, Tim <em>The Diet Myth: Why the Secret to Health and Weight Loss is Already in Your Gut</em></li>
</ul>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51MzBLv5PjL._SL160_.jpg" />

</div>
<p>Another excellent one written by a practicing scientist and a good complement to <em>Follow Your Gut</em>. The author’s concise writing style packs multiple interesting examples and facts on each page. Divided into chapters based on type of food, I learned about what’s proven and what’s unknown about the effects of different diets on health.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51dly8s5QrL._SL160_.jpg" />

</div>
<p>Another great overview that explains to the ordinary person the implications of the microbiome. Well-written, full of interesting facts, but sticks strictly to mainstream science. For example, although the author explains the concept of “leaky gut”, she observes it skeptically as an unproven hypothesis, rather than jump whole-hog into diagnoses. Best parts discuss the gut role on behavior (“Mind Control”), with detailed examples from autism research, Whipple’s Disease, and more. The book includes a list of the highest-quality references, but unfortunately it’s not complete, so many of the facts are hard to follow up.</p>
<ul>
<li>Blaser,Martin <em>Missing Microbes: How the Overuse of Antibiotics Is Fueling Our Modern Plagues</em></li>

</ul>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Another book that explains a provocative idea that our immune systems need regular stimulation by parasites and other infectious agents, or we risk unpleasant side effects in the form of allergies, diabetes, and many other nasty conditions. The remarkable correlation between the hygiene of modernity and the rise of autoimmune diseases makes for powerful evidence that science is far behind in understanding all the consequences of our current lifestyles.</p>

</ul>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Short, practical summary of what’s known about microbial infections, with suggestions for how to manage and treat them. I liked the chapters on the mouth and skin, with practical advice about how to choose toothpaste and soap.</p>

</ul>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51e3sYJfomL._SL160_.jpg" />

</div>
<p>Well-written, concise overview of what’s known about epigenetics and “Fat Genes”, “Gay Genes”, “Infidelity Genes”, “Bacteria Genes” and more. This is the same author of <em>The Diet Myth</em> discussed above, written before he became aware of the microbiome.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51pgs53-dJL._SL160_.jpg" />

</div>
<p>Heavily researched and footnoted (the last hundred pages are references), it’s an overview of the practical side of what’s known about the microbiome. When I’m looking for a short summary of particular conditions (Parkinsons, Alzheimers), I reach for Dr. Matthews book first.</p>
<p>My complaint is that it’s written by a clinician, not a scientist or journalist, and it’s hard to tell when he’s writing from opinion (e.g. his rants against GMOs) or whether there’s a real scientific consensus on something (e.g. the role of <em>Bifidobacterium</em>).</p>
</div>
<div id="not-recommended" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.4</span> Not Recommended</h3>
<p>Life is short, so to help you be more efficient, here’s a list of books that I think are a waste of time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mullin, Gerard E. <em>The Gut Balance Revolution: Boost Your Metabolism, Restore Your Inner Ecology, and Lose the Weight for Good!</em></li>
</ul>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515i5gSlGjL._SL160_.jpg" />

</div>
<p>Although Dr. Mullin has been thinking about the microbiome for years, most of this book is about standard alternative diet advice, with references to Omega-6, FODMAPs, Mediterranean Diet, etc. but not really much specific about the microbiome. Don’t waste your money.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kellman, Raphael <em>The Microbiome Diet</em></li>
</ul>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41a1ffMf3XL._SL160_.jpg" />

</div>
<p>Includes the typical formulaic suggestions for how to cure a bad microbiome (Remove! Replace! Reinoculate! Repair!) and lots of sweeping, unproven suggestions for what to eat: “Cinnamon balances blood sugar” with absolutely nothing to connect it to the microbiome. There is a nice list of “superfoods” including natural prebiotics like jicama, but again you must take his word for it that this somehow benefits the microbiome. Just google it and save the effort.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gershon, Michael <em>The Second Brain: The Scientific Basis of Gut Instinct and a groundbreaking new understanding of nervous disorders of the stomach and intestine</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Although this was a ground-breaking classic when first published in the 1990s, much of the information is obsolete thanks to new technologies, especially the new sequencing methods that gave rise to our understanding of the microbiome. The more recent book, <em>Gut</em> by Giulia Enders is a more up-to-date description of the anatomical aspects of the digestive system, though Gershon is still worth reading because of its details as well as its outsized influence since its publication.</p>
</div>
<div id="other" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.5</span> Other</h3>
<p>Just about any new health book from the past few years will touch on the microbiome, but I didn’t find much specifically microbiome-related that was useful or new in books by David Asprey (“The Bulletproof Diet”), Tim Ferriss’ <em>Four Hour Body</em>, or Chris Kresser’s <em>Paleo Code</em>. You may find these books useful for other reasons, like the detailed discussions of specific foods, but you’ll learn little about the microbiome.</p>
<p><em>The Bulletproof Diet</em>, for example, stresses the now-disproven Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio too much.</p>

<p>If you’re new to the microbiome and would like to dig into the academic papers that drive the field, here’s the selection that I consider required reading.</p>
<p>Microbiome science is in its infancy, but its enormous potential makes it an environment rich in highly speculative research, often with results that are overturned rapidly with new discoveries.
