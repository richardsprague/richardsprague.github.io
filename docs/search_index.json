["preface.html", "Preface", " Preface Seems like everyone in the health field is interested in the microbiome, and resourceful authors hoping to attract an audience are repurposing their previous work so it can include the word “microbiome”. So if you have a draft of a book called, say, The Best Diet Ever: How to Lose Weight and Feel Great, you change the title to The Best Microbiome Diet Ever: The Scientific-Sounding Way to Lose Weight and Feel Great. Microbiome science has a magical combination of features that make it attractive to potential hypesters: The field is new, and interesting discoveries are announced nearly every day, so you won’t draw skepticism if you can credibly claim some new insight. Data abounds. Every person is covered in thousands of species (probably a lot more), and the types and varieties change hourly. No matter when or how you take a sample, you’ll find something new. There really is something there. We are surrounded by gazillions of microbes, many of which have co-evolved with humans and are well-adapted to our bodies. Intriguing relationships have been discovered between microbes and many — maybe most — human conditions, including a plethora of diseases as well as behavior, mood, and cognition — areas you don’t usually associate with infections. You can change it. Unlike your human genes, the microbiome shifts in response to food, medicine, environment, and many other variables that scientists are just beginning to understand. It really does seem likely that many of the seemingly far-out claims about the microbiome may hold up, eventually. While this makes me excited about the potential of the microbiome, I’m also wary of over-exaggerated claims. When I read or hear something, my first instinct is to ask “how do you know?” It turns out that in the majority of cases, when I ask most experts about how they know something specific about the microbiome, the answer essentially amounts to “I read it somewhere”. Oh sure, the better experts will speak more eloquently, pointing to a peer-reviewed study, as if that settles it. But that’s just a fancy way of saying “I read it somewhere”. This book is for those who want to know the truth for themselves. You may have a specific reason you want to understand more about the microbiome: perhaps you know somebody who suffers from a condition about which “experts” disagree. Or perhaps (like me) you are healthy but are simply curious and want to be as healthy as possible. You’ve read a number of books, but are frustrated at all the contradictory advice. At some point you decided you’d rather just do it yourself. That’s what this book is for. Here’s an example: I know somebody who was having sleep troubles. I read somewhere that the body’s sleep hormones are produced mostly by bacteria. Digging deeper I learned that some of those organisms have names and are well-studied enough that it’s known that they prefer particular types of food, of which plain old potato starch is one. Eat a little potato starch mixed with some water and those bacteria, being well-fed, will multiply — and produce more of the sleep hormones you’re missing. Okay, sounds good. But I don’t want you to stop there. I want the story to continue with “so I tried it myself and sure enough, I slept great!”. Better yet, show me your actual microbiome test results: demonstrate how you had low levels of the microbe before trying your experiment, and now you have high levels. You don’t have to do a fancy study. You don’t have to run a randomized control trial. Just show that it worked one time, on you. For the past three years, I’ve been doing exactly that. After hundreds of microbiome tests on myself, and even more that I’ve seen from others, I’ve compiled my own list of experiments, some of which work and some which don’t. In the course of doing these self-experiments, I developed a number of computer tools that helped me understand my microbiome. Those tools are available now for free and this book will show you how to use them. I think you’ll find that it’s quite easy to learn some basic things about the microbiome, and when you do, you’re much better off than if you simply say “I read it somewhere”. "],
["getting-started.html", "Chapter 1 Getting Started 1.1 The most common phyla 1.2 How are you different?", " Chapter 1 Getting Started Let’s jump right in with a specific example. You just received an email that uBiome has finished processing your sample. Now what do you do? The first stop is the uBiome Explorer web dashboard, where you’ll see an overview of your results. The instructions there are self-explanatory and you’ll learn most of what you need to know by simply clicking around. The following explanation will help you dig deeper. If you only have one sample, your page will look something like this: Figure : uBiome Explorer Insights Overview That’s the Insights pane, designed to tell you the highlights. If this is your first time here, go ahead and breeze through this page, but don’t get caught up on details. As we’ll learn, scientists have barely scratched the surface of what we will eventually understand about the microbiome, so think of this page as a teaser – a hint of the potential. If your results show something you didn’t expect, say on diversity or body weight, don’t worry: it almost certainly just means that the Insights pane is wrong about you. Later we’ll see how to pull out far more interesting and useful results. Click next on the “My Bacteria” tab. The colorful pie chart there is your first high-level glimpse of the bacteria found in your sample. Hover over it with your mouse (or tap with your finger if you’re on a phone or iPad), to see a pop-up view of the approximate percentages. You’re seeing a phyla-based look at your microbiome. As we’ll learn in more detail later, this is a very high level view, a bit like how a Martian might see life on earth from far in outer space. Keep in mind that by “very high level”, we mean very high, the equivalent of seeing life only at the level of “vertebrate” and “invertebrate”. The incomprehensible diversity of bacterial life means that at this level, you don’t even bother separating fish from one another or for that matter, from land animals: just lump all of them together. At the phyla level, mammals, reptiles, fish – they’re all the same. Similarly, when you see the phylum Firmicutes, for example, think of it as having as encompassing as much variation as all the vertebrates, from those on land, in the ocean, big, small, harmless, dangerous and everything in between. In other words, this first approximation is pretty crude. This time the various phyla are represented as percentages of the whole, so some of them are relegated to tiny slices of the pie. That doesn’t necessarily mean they’re unimportant, though, because in the world of life, even some tiny populations can exert an outsized influence. A wolf is just one of a gazillion different creatures in Yellowstone National Park, but that is little comfort to a rabbit. Remember too that so far we’re treating each individual organism as if it’s the same size as the others, but that’s an oversimplification too, just like it would be a mistake to assume that elephants matter more because they’re bigger than humans. All we know at the phylum level is that proportionately, certain large classes of bacteria are more well-represented than others. That may not sound like much to go on, but as we’ll see, scientists have been able to learn quite a bit from tiny clues like this. 1.1 The most common phyla Most westerners will find their sample dominated by two phyla: Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. These are so common in healthy people that it’s tempting to assume this is “natural” or “normal”, but like much else with the microbiome, the situation is different outside the western world, a clue that it’s difficult to summarize a single individual’s microbiome as “good” or “bad.” It all depends. Firmicutes is usually the most common, and for good reason: it’s very good at sucking energy out of the types of high-fat, highly-processed food we eat in industrialized societies. For that reason, some scientists have claimed it might associate with obesity, since its presence might indicate a gut that is highly-optimized to pull as many calories as possible from food. On the other hand, it’s not hard to find skinny people with lots of Firmicutes, so this theory doesn’t always hold. I’ve seen it lower in vegetarians, and I suspect that maybe it reflects diet more than weight. Bacteroidetes is not as good at digesting fat, so it sticks to high-fiber foods like those in vegetables, which is why vegetarians tend to have high levels of this phylum. It’s often most prominent outside the industrialized world, too, where people eat less meat. Prevotella is associated with carbohydrates. Proteobacteria: If you’re an otherwise normal omnivore and see double-digit amounts of this it can be a sign that your body was recently under attack. That’s because Proteobacteria For example, in one of my tests I had 14% Proteobacteria, which often is elevated in people with gastric disorders like Crohn’s disease. That doesn’t mean that Proteobacteria is bad; in fact, it could mean the opposite, that we need more of these to fight back invaders. In my case the unusually high amount came right after a long trip to Central America, during which my body was exposed to many new and possibly pathogenic microbes. My Proteobacteria fell soon after I returned to the U.S. and my normal diet. 1.2 How are you different? Since so little about the microbiome is well-understood, most of the time it will be hard to interpret your results by themselves. This is where the power of uBiome’s citizen science can help, because the web page lets you easily compare your results with other people. That first bacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus is an extremophile, usually only found in harsh environments, like the impossibly acidic human stomach. Why would I have so many more than other people like me? One clue is the similarly-high levels of Proteobacteria, which as we just noted is often high in people with gastro-intestinal issues. Maybe I was exposed to something that released a bit of stomach acid, and its extremophile Deinococcus into my colon. Verrucomicrobia is elevated too, though not by much. This is a Phylum that is generally associated with soil microbes, though it’s not unusual to find it in the gut as well. I looked back at my notes during the period of a few days before this sample, and interestingly I had been doing work in my garden at the time. We have deer and other animals that come near our house…is it possible that I was exposed to some animal excrement, maybe some of which somehow made it into my gut? It’s just a theory, and perhaps an unlikely one, but I wonder if my body was fighting some type of pathogen as a result of my outdoor activities. Now before we get too excited, keep in mind that I never felt the slightest bit ill during this period. Can I thank my microbiome? Perhaps I was exposed to something nasty, the kind of bug that under other circumstances might have wreaked havoc and left me terribly sick for days. Now I have no way of knowing for sure, but this tidbit makes me wonder if maybe my microbiome acted as a guardian angel, protecting me from something much worse. Similarly, your own results comparing to others may lead you to clues about aspects of your environment you didn’t otherwise suspect. Incidentally, since this test I’ve sent dozens of additional samples to uBiome and never saw that Deinococcus thing again. Good riddance? or maybe I should be thankful for the protection, and hope that little bits of it may still be present, undetectably in my stomach, waiting to fight another external enemy the next time I come in contact with something in the soil.

["science.html", "Chapter 2 Learn the Science 2.1 Microbes everywhere 2.2 Microbes and health 2.3 An intro to biology", " Chapter 2 Learn the Science Living microbes are found everywhere on earth, often in surprising places. Let’s look at some examples to get an idea of how ubiquitous and hardy they can be, and then we’ll back up with a short intro to the science of biology. Finally, we’ll discuss how scientists study the human microbiome. 2.1 Microbes everywhere Virtually all of the life around you is invisible. We tend to forget about things we can’t see, ignoring that which is literally under our noses, but it’s there: living, eating, reproducing lifeforms of incredible tenacity and surprisingly important effects on the world we can see. Life is incredibly tenacious, fighting for and keeping its niche in just about environment it encounters. In the sky, deep underground, in the most barren habitats cold or hot anywhere on earth, there are lifeforms. The vast majority of these are microbes, so small we can’t see them, but small doesn’t mean irrelevant. In fact, the more that science understands about the invisible microbial world, the more it is clear that these uncountably numerous creatures exert a much bigger effect than we think. Every traditional culture recognizes a role for the invisible, often translated with words like “spirit” or “life force”, sometimes with more expressive terms like “angels”, “demons”, “gods” or even, simply, “God”. Sometimes the more serious people dismiss these invisible forces as so much superstition, as though truth is made only of things we can see, but of course that’s not quite true either. With the right instruments, we can see many invisible things; some of the greatest discoveries happen when a new gadget makes people aware of a world that was previously hidden. The invisible world of microbes is like that, with new, low-cost technologies showing us incredible, rich, living universes waiting to be explored. The word “microbe” refers to any tiny organism that carries its own genetic information for purposes of propagating itself. Far too small to see with the naked eye, dozens could fit inside a typical human cell. Although it’s common to think of microbes and bacteria as the same thing, in fact there are at least seven different types of microorganism: bacteria, extremophile life forms called archaea that live and thrive in environments too challenging for bacteria, protozoa, algae, fungi, viruses, and some multi-cellular animal parasites such as helminths. Each of these has its own characteristic body type, means of reproduction, and ways of moving around. Let’s look next at some of these environments and see the odd places where microbes have been found. 2.1.1 Microbes in the air Even the sky contains living microbes. Pierre Amato is a staff scientist at the Institut de Chimie de Clermont-Ferrand in France who for decades has been sampling clouds to determine their precise contents, and sure enough: he finds plenty of life there, usually between 1,000 and 10,000 bacterial cells per milliliter — not all that different from the amount you’d find in alpine snow. Like every living organism, these cells must soak up water and other nutrients, converting them into energy and various by-products, which collectively have a massive effect on the overall atmosphere, more than enough to affect climate.1 source: ASMScience] The upper atmosphere is a harsh place for life: regular freezing and thawing, constant bombardment of UV radiation from the sun during the day, cold, subzero freezing temperatures at night, high speed, unpredictable winds that quickly disperse any colonies. Plus, at any moment these organisms can find themselves flushed to the ground in a rainstorm, where they’ll need to adapt again. These extreme conditions are just another day in the life for one species commonly found in clouds, Pseudomonas syringae, which harbors a protein in its cellular wall that reacts to cold temperatures, alternately preventing and allowing a water molecule to turn into ice and back. It doesn’t take many of these reactions to generate precipitation. With so many cells constantly floating in the atmosphere, even small changes in concentration — perhaps due to human activity on the ground — can, at least theoretically, make the difference between rainfall and drought. How much of an effect is hard to say: you can imagine how difficult it is to study bacteria floating in the sky. Our inability to access these environments is often the biggest reason we remain ignorant of the life that is found there. Traces of plankton, for example, have been found in space, on the surface of the International Space Station, where they are believed to have floated from the upper atmosphere.2 Why?! How did they get there! Who knows! What is known is that between a quarter and two-thirds of microbes in the air are entirely new and undiscovered organisms. A study of the “air microbiome” above New York City found bacteria and viruses that apparently originated in water, soil, vegetation, as well as in animals and humans, but even then few patterns emerge. Although there appear to be distinct microbial environments, on the land versus water, for example, overall many of these organisms are quite hardy and seem to find themselves migrating all over the place. Scientists studying a water-filled fracture two miles underground at the Mponeng gold mine near Johannesburg, South Africa, discovered Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator by accident, after noticing odd levels of hydrogen compounds, by-products of the activity of an isolated bacterial colony.3 Interestingly, this organism is a member of the same Firmicutes phylum that dominates human guts, though this particular bacterium evolved quite separately from us: it hasn’t been exposed to surface water for millions of years. A systematic study of its genome revealed that, unlike other bacteria that usually live in co-dependent colonies, this one can survive all by itself, feeding on tiny bits of radioactive energy from uranium decay in an environment far removed from all other energy sources. It’s not a great life: these creatures reproduce rarely, only once every few hundred or thousand years. But at least they don’t have to worry about being consumed by predators down there. Subglacial Lake Whillans is a lake buried under more than 800 meters of ice in the West Antarctic. A careful underground bore hole inserted by a team from Louisiana State University in 2014 found more than 4,000 different species of bacteria surviving under that ice. The total bacterial count was not that different from what you’d find in surface lakes on other parts of the planet, a fact that is especially surprising for an environment that hasn’t had a ray of light in millions of years. The bacteria instead thrive on iron, sulphur, and nitrogen as energy sources.4 Those may not be the deepest examples. A Cold War-era Soviet team drilling the world’s deepest hole, were forced to abandon the project in 1994 at 12,261 meters (or 7.5 miles) underground, when they hit temperatures above 180 °C (or 356 °F), too hot for their equipment. Apparently the conditions weren’t too hot for life, though: the nine-inch diameter Kola Superdeep Borehole5 found 24 species of fossilized plankton among the two-billion-year-old rocks down there. Of course, fossils are not the same thing as living microbes, but even dead remnants at that depth is evidence of the tenacity of life. Still other microbes thrive in radioactive environments, like the dangerous interior of a nuclear reactor. Deinococcus radiodurans is an extremophile member of Phylum Deinococcus-Thermus that boasts an impressive built-in DNA repair mechanism that lets it survive cold, vacuum, acid, light, dehydration – you name it. It remains unbothered by radiation levels more than 1,000 times higher than would kill a human. 2.1.2 Microbes around you You don’t have to go to extreme conditions to find unusual microbes. Microbes thrive whereever humans live, and they are in our everyday environment too. The recent PathoMap study of DNA collected from the New York City subway found that, like the air above, half of the microbes we walk past everyday are unknown to science.6 Most of the organisms are apparently benign, with no obvious affect on humans one way or another. Even when known pathogens are found, including Yersinia pestis (Bubonic plague) and Bacillus anthracis (anthrax), the lack of reported infections indicates that probably these organisms are busying themselves for some other, unknown, and maybe even useful purpose. Generally the microbes seem content to exist patiently with no apparent affect on the environment. A station flooded by Hurricane Sandy showed a similarity to a marine environment a year after the disaster. Humans are the source of many unusual microbes in our environment. Regularly shedding 1.5 million skin cells per hour, leftover inhabitants of our bodies can colonize a hotel room in less than six hours.7 2.1.3 Microbes you eat with your food We like our food pure and clean, and so do microbes. Well, some microbes. Freshly-washed produce is a just a colonization opportunity for many species, for whom the lack of competition is a shot at a fresh start. Before washing, plants are covered in microbes, from the flowers and branches to the roots. Seeds planted in sterilized soil will germinate, but can’t grow regardless of the nutrients, water, or sunlight you give them. The relationship between soil bacteria and plants is a complicated and understudied one, but what is known is that every plant hosts its own unique species of microbe in a symbiotic relationship as tight as any on earth. The microbes tangled in the roots of a corn or wheat plant, for example, are highly specific to that particular strain. Swap out the microbes, or – worse – sterilize the soil, and the plant can’t take advantage of the nutrients sitting right at hand, because they are in a form that is useless until digested by microbes. After harvest and processing, our meals still contain a surprising variety of microbes. Of course, sometimes this is deliberate: some of us eat fermented foods like sauerkraut or yogurt to ingest the microbes that were grown to make their special flavor or texture. But even everyday foods, like raw vegetables, will naturally be covered with healthy levels of microbes. You will ingest somewhere between 1.4 million and 1.3 trillion microbes per day, depending on what type of diet you follow. Eat according to USDA guidelines and you’ll be at the high end of the range, emphasizing fruits and vegetables, lean meat, dairy, and whole grains; the lower end is more typical of a vegan diet, or even a typical American convenience food-style diet of “junk food”. Interestingly, you’ll get roughly the same diversity of microbes no matter which diet you follow, although there can be a difference depending on whether the food is raw or cooked.8 We eat plants for their nutrients, but what exactly counts as a “nutrient” is often in the eye of the beholder. Plants don’t like to be eaten any more than the rest of us, and they have developed powerful defense mechanisms to keep out predators, including microbes. In fact, it’s those anti-microbial properties that make many plants medicinally useful. One estimate showed that of 18,000 plants available to Native Americans, only 1,625 were used as food; but 2,564 were used as drugs, many of which are specifically there to manipulate microbes.9 Extrapolate that to the estimated 500,000 different plants on earth, only about 1-10% of which are useful as foods to humans, and it becomes clear that microbes play a big role in which plants thrive and which don’t. You’re not necessarily immune from accidental antibiotic ingestion if you simply avoid eating antibiotic-treated meat. Between 70% - 90% of the antibiotics given to farm animals are ultimately discharged in their manure, which if administered as fertilizer, can coat the soil used for growing food plants. Although antibiotics naturally degrade over time, the process can take months and under many conditions, giving ample time to be taken up in to plants that we eat, so even hard-core vegans may be getting more antibiotics than they like. 2.1.4 Anti-microbials in food Plants don’t like to be eaten any more than you do. Even plants that depend on pollinators, or those that spread their seeds by being ingested by birds, they don’t actually like to be eaten whole and completely. Leafy grasses attract ruminants like cows or sheep with large tasty fibrous leaves that the plant offers in order to bring in the high-nitrogen feces that will help the plants grow better. 2.1.5 Fermented food In some foods, living microbes aren’t along just for the ride – they are the ride. Most raw foods will quickly spoil if left uneaten for too long. We say “spoiled”, but really we mean the food is consumed by bacterial species who leave by-products that are not edible or pleasant for humans. Under the right circumstances, though, food can Before refrigerators, the long-term preservation of food Yes, much of that yogurt makes it past the stomach and into the gut. 2.2 Microbes and health The great French scientist Louis Pasteur, working as a physician in the 1800s, was the first to popularize the idea that the world is covered in germs, invisible agents that he associated with food spoilage and disease. Simple steps at hygiene, he discovered, could make conditions inhospitable for them, enabling better food storage and dramatically fewer illnesses. Working as a chemistry professor in the 1850s, one of his students, the son of a local wine manufacturer, sought his help to solve problems with souring. Subsequent investigations led him to conclude that invisible yeasts were the culprit, and that exposure to air could affect the rate of fermentation. Pasteur’s emphasis on controlling these microbes led to a general association of germs as pathogens, a bad, even evil force that we must destroy, every single time. The only good germ is a dead germ. And for good reason. The development of effective disinfectants, and then antibiotics – germ killers –- was one of the greatest medical achievements of all time, saving the lives of a significant fraction of the human race. Before Pasteur, urban life was a precarious game of chance against diseases that seemed to come and go randomly. Thanks to the development of the Germ Theory of Disease, it was suddenly possible to imagine a world where deadly illnesses and infections could be controlled and perhaps eliminated. Now, every day of your life, modern amenities like running water and flush toilets keep you healthy simply by controlling the growth of microbes. Some of these are truly nasty. The bacterium that causes Cholera, Vibrio cholerae, after infecting the small intestine, promptly hijacks the body’s natural defense systems into sending a large stream of water through the colon to flush out all other bacteria. Normally, this would be an appropriate response to an invasion, but by hiding above the colon, Vibrio cholerae continues to breed above the main flow of water. The resulting diarrhea is so fierce that the patient is literally unable to drink enough to make up for the outflow, and dies of dehydration within days. As an added bonus, that water that the body pushes out so fiercely is itself full of V. cholerae, who use the opportunity to infect people who come in contact with the water. Some bacteria simply use the darkness and wet warmth of the colon as a breeding ground, happily feasting on the materials they find there. They cause trouble not by what they eat, but by what they excrete: nasty toxins that mess up some other part of the body. Clostridium botulinum produces a neurotoxic protein that can weaken or freeze nerve cells. Botulinum is the most acutely lethal toxin known – only 2 billionths of a gram can kill. Almost as deadly to people as the plutonium in a nuclear bomb, just a few pounds under the right conditions would kill everyone on earth. 2.2.1 How much is toxic? Some Shigella species, for example, become infectious with a starter colony of as few as ten organisms.10 Does Proteobacteria play a role? TS: Only 52 of the 4200 compounds found in normal mice blood were identified in germ-free mice. The implication is that most of the chemicals in our blood are synthesized by microbes. The toxins produced by the Clostridium genus are among the most dangerous. Botulism (C. Botulinin) Tetanus (C. Tetani), gangrene (C. perfringens), and of course C. Dificile. Toxic food and fast food mice Feed junk food to germ-free mice and nothing happens Western diet induces dysbiosis with increased E coli in CEABAC10 mice, alters host barrier function favouring AIEC colonisation. Martinez-Medina M1 ) 2.2.2 Food Allergies If you attended elementary school before the 1980s, you can remember a time before nut allergies, when school lunches served peanut butter to everyone without the slightest worry that it might cause problems. 2.2.3 Gluten It’s been well-established that a gluten free diet impacts the microbiome. This shouldn’t be too surprising, given that gluten is a nutrient for some bacteria but not others. But what about people who show an unusual sensitivity, even allergy, to gluten? What’s the cause? Recently the idea of a gluten free diet has taken on fad diet status. Despite surprisingly little research evidence that it can quantitatively affect health, millions of people swear that gluten gives them various ailments from poor digestion to brain fog. If you don’t believe it, they’ll say, try it yourself and see; and sure enough, many of those who go off gluten claim big health benefits. Eating is usually a zero-sum game: stop eating one thing (say, the gluten in wheat) and you’ll end up eating more of something else (rice or corn). Is it the switch to a different diet — and the anticipation of success that this brings — that makes people feel better, or is there something really significant about gluten itself? The experts say no, with one important exception. A tiny fraction of people do suffer from Celiac disease, a known disorder of the body’s ability to handle gluten. There are well-established tests that can definitely tell whether you have Celiac disease or not, and although the vast majority of people test negative, those who are true Celiacs will immediately and obviously benefit from a gluten free diet. But what’s driving the difference? As usual, the genetic evidence isn’t completely lock-tight. Although a third of the population have particular versions of the (DQ2 or DQ8) of a cellular receptor called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA), only a tiny minority go on to develop serious gluten sensitivities. Some studies indicate gluten sensitivity arises at an early age, and that perhaps celiac disease can be prevented by exposing babies to gluten at just the right moment, but other studies say the opposite.11 These are all clues that the microbiome may be involved, and sure enough, many studies show a definite difference between healthy microbiomes and those with clinically-proven Celiac disease.12 But because Celiac sufferers tend to eat differently than non-sufferers, it can be hard to tell how much of the microbiome is a result of a different diet, and how much is due to the disorder. Another clue happens further up the digestive system. Spanish researchers looking at the small intestine found curiously similar microbiomes in both healthy and celiac patients..13 The difference happened at the functional level of what those bacteria do, and not necessarily in just whether the microbe is present or absent. Lactobacillus, it turns out, is one of the best degraders of gluten14, but there are others: Bacillus pumilus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most interestingly, unlike Lactobacillus, some of these bacteria can do more than just digest the gluten: they appear to contain enzymes that transform the gluten — pointing to the possibility that the enzymes produced by these microbes could be purified and used to eliminate traces of gluten from food products. So if Celiac disease is caused by a change in the way some microbes function, how did that change happen in the first place? One theory is that it’s a virus. Researchers at the University of Chicago and University of Pittsburgh were able to supercharge the way mice react to gluten by infecting them with a reovirus that apparently changes something about the body’s immune response in the presence of the gluten protein.15 Where did this modern plague come from? The first case to appear in medical journal didn’t happen until 1969 (Golbert), and examples were extremely rare before that. In fact, the very first mention of a food allergy happened about 100 years ago (Schloss). Martin Blaser thinks something odd has happened because of the overuse of antibiotics.

And then, how do we apply what we know about the zillions of organisms around us, to how they relate to what’s inside us? The methodically classification and analysis of life is the science of biology, and like life itself it is a very broad field. Fortunately, despite the incredible variations, scientists have discovered a few simple traits and rules that apply to every life form. For the special life form homo sapiens, we have also learned a number of simplifications that will let us talk in more detail later. A crash course in biology A crash course in microbiology A crash course in anatomy Learn more from (Falony et al. 2016) 2.3.1 The Basics The study of biology starts with the cell, those tiny self-contained blocks that are the very definition of life. From the most humble microbe to the biggest animal, every living thing is made of these structures, which are really just miniature chemical reactors that pull external molecules from their environment and reassemble them in ways that perpetuate the reaction. Everything in the universe tends over time to fall into disorganized entropy, but cells contain many tricks, honed over billions of years of evolution, to thrive. Despite the diversity of life, a surprising number of those tricks are shared by all cells: a wall to protect and allow exchanges with the outside world, a means of storing information through DNA, and of course a process of reproduction. The biggest technical difference among cells is not size or even function, but rather the distinction between two broad categories: eukaryotes, which are the cells of everything from corn plants to humans to fungi and amoebas, and prokaryotes, which are always single-celled bacteria and other microbes. It’s interesting enough that all life could be characterized into these distinct groups, but if you look at the DNA that defines each cell, you will find some other odd differences that hint at more refined relationships among living things. A cell’s DNA contains all the information needed to create another copy of itself; even the instructions for how to do the copying are just a sequence of predictable DNA letters written somewhere in the genetic code of all cells. This very important copying function is performed by a ribosome, which is a complicated but well-studied part of every living thing. Because the ribosome has such a fundamental function, it tends not to fall prey to many mutations over time; after all, a single DNA letter change in the ribosome is almost always fatal to the entire cell. But every so often — maybe every few million years — there is a mutation in some part of the ribosome, and this leads us to a clever way to understand better how living things are related to one another. Humans and monkeys, for example, may differ in many different parts of their DNA, but their ribosomes are nearly identical. In fact, the ribosomes of all mammals and even all vertebrates are virtually the same. Well, there are some differences, but interestingly the differences between large, obvious groupings like vertebrates or invertebrates are much more significant than the differences between different vertebrates, or between mammals or other creatures. In fact we can even quantify the differences, and scientists over the years have done exactly that. The ribosomes of humans and monkeys, for example, are different in only 10 places — practically nothing in a molecule that consists of a few thousand nucleotides connecting dozens of proteins. Similarly, the ribosomes of vertebrates and invertebrates are different in perhaps 100 places – clearly much more significant than the differences within each grouping, but still not terribly different relative to the entire ribosome. The ribosomes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, on the other hand, can be quite different: perhaps 1000 places (to continue this very-rough-but-sort-of-useful metric). The point is that even at the molecular, ribosome level, we can see obvious genetic differences even if the physical differences between two organisms aren’t necessarily obvious at first glance. A one-celled eurkaryote, like an amoeba or algae, for example, might seem like it should share something in common with a one-celled prokaryote, but looks are entirely deceiving: nobody looking just at the ribosome could possible mistake these as similar. Now, scientists have mapped the differences in ribosomal structure among nearly all living things and this general rule always applies: the groupings of life forms are directly related to the similarities or differences in their ribosomes. Meanwhile, scientists have made estimates of how long it takes, given various assumptions, for a series of step-by-step mutations to result in a differently-sized ribosome. In other words, using some basic chemistry that is easily demonstrated experimentally in a lab, we can offer some reasonable guesses for the number of generations it would take for a given level of random mutations to result in the differently-sized ribosomes we see in nature. Add it all up, and behold: you can see a reasonable fit with the clues we have in the fossil record and the geological record for the same creatures. None of this is perfect, of course, but the point is that we have a crude way to quantify how different one organism is from another and, if you like, we can guess how long it would take for a single common ancestor to accumulate enough random mutations to account for the differences between any two life forms. So far so good. Next let’s imagine we have a circle, where a single cell begins in the middle, divides into two cells, and those cells divide, etc. for zillions of years until there are clear ribosomal differences between each line. Let’s call this a family tree and take all known life forms and spread them into this circle. If you do that, you’ll find that the number of mutations necessary to generate all the variation found in eukaryotes – everything from corn plants to people – would take up only a tiny sliver of that circle. The rest of life — in particular the microbial life of prokaryotes – is so unimaginably diverse, that a space alien looking at earth’s lifeforms could well conclude that the differences between humans and corn plants aren’t significant enough to worry about. That’s how complicated the world of bacteria can be. 2.3.2 Taxonomy How do you talk about the relationships between various different life forms? A taxon is a simple unit of life. A homo sapiens is a taxon, but so is a primate. A mammal is a taxon too. It might seem odd in the ordinary biological world to bother using the same term ‘taxon’ to refer to all of those units, but for bacteria and anything that reproduces asexually, it’s an important distinction because often, taxonomists don’t agree about whether a group of organisms is part of the same taxon or not. Since Carl Linnaeus in the 1700’s, the science of taxonomy divides all life into seven major categories: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species (which I was taught in sixth grade to remember by the mnemonic “King Philip Came Over for Girl Scouts”). Bacteria make up their own kingdom. Just as the animal kingdom includes everything from humans to jellyfish to beetles, the diversity of bacterial life is enormous, a point which can’t be emphasized too much. This is true at every rank in the taxonomy. Even two organisms that are the same at a lower rank, like genus, might have radically different affects on the human body, just as a member of the animal genus Canis could be anything from a wolf or coyote to a Chihuahua. You cannot mix and match these ranks. If you know something about the number of organisms in one genus, for example, this is meaningful only in comparison to the numbers of another genus. Keep that in mind during our analysis. Sometimes there are different results, as noted by (Olesen and Alm 2016). 2.3.3 Microbiology All life runs on three chemical building blocks: DNA, RNA, and proteins. Each of these is an arbitrarily-long chain of repeating molecules called nucleotides (DNA or RNA) and amino acids (proteins). Due to constraints on the way atoms interact, the set of building blocks is fixed. All DNA is composed of only four nucleotides: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, represented by the letters ATGC. RNA is composed of the same molecules, except that uracile (U) is substituted for thymine. Similarly, proteins are constructed with only 20 different amino acids, which can again be represented by a short three-character abbreviation. The correspondence between these different proteins and combinations of DNA or RNA is referred to as the genetic code. As a programmer looking through all of this, you may immediately be inspired to write your own software version of this. After all, the remarkable consistency between all of these building blocks cries out for manipulation by computer. In fact, that’s exactly what bioinformaticians do, and numerous software packages have been developed to make it easy to treat these building blocks of life like ordinary computer strings. Perhaps the biggest challenge is the volume of data to be handled, which can easily be measured in gigabytes for a simple organism, but can require entire server farms in the case of some real-world biological systems. For that reason, much of bioinformatics is about optimizations to improve the speed of processing a large data set, or to simply the presentation in a way that can reveal the most biologically interesting aspects of a problem without wading in over-complexity. One special protein, DNA, can store information. 2.3.4 Human Anatomy Finally, to round out our overview of how biologists study the microbiome, let’s get specific about aspects of our own human bodies, and break it down into components, each of which as we’ll see play hosts to unique microbial communities. 2.3.4.1 Mouth 2.3.4.2 Stomach 2.3.4.3 Appendix Somewhere near the border between the small intestine and the large intestine (colon), there is a small, pinkie-like appendage bulging inconspicuously into the abdominal cavity. For most of the period of modern western medicine, nobody knew its function, other as a source of severe pain when it occasionally exploded in infections that until the development of antibiotics were usually fatal. Appendicitis used to be very rare (3-4 cases/year till 1890, up to 113 by 1918), which was fortunate, because there was no treatment. It was a sad fact that, for example the only death among the hundred or so frontiersmen and explorers on the Lewis and Clark expedition in the early 1800s was caused by appendicitis — a terrible, painful death in the wilderness but one that would have been just as inevitable at the finest hospitals in the world at the time. What’s known is that the appendix apparently houses three things: tissue from the immune system, a bunch of what are called IgA antibodies that fight infections, and tons of bacteria. What’s also known is that people who have their appendix removed surgically — usually as a result of one of those terrible infections — recover to live apparently normal lives, with no side effects even decades upon decades later. So what is the appendix doing? One clue comes from a recent study of 254 patients recovering from a C. Difficil infection, a horridly tenacious bacterium that has gained near-complete resistance to antibiotics and is notoriously difficult to treat. In the study, those with an appendix saw their infections come back 11% of the time, but those with no appendix suffered re-infection rates of 44% — a large and significant difference that has caused most scientists to speculate that the appendix is harboring something that enables the body to recover after a microbial disaster. My own interest in this subject is not idle curiosity. About fifty years ago, doctors at a small town hospital gave an appendectomy to my five-year-old self in order to treat an unusual belly ache. While doing what was apparently an exploratory surgery to find the cause, they came upon my otherwise healthy-looking appendix and decided on the spot to simply remove it. “Why not?” I’m sure they thought at the time. “If nothing else, it’ll prevent him from appendicitis”, which is as tautologically sound a reason as any. Did that change me, somehow? Am I fundamentally different because for most of my life I’ve been missing an important microbe safety zone that the rest of you enjoy? Science doesn’t know the answers, and even when there are studies based on well-conducted experiments, I can’t know the answer unless I do the experiment on me. [Hint: that’s exactly what I did: see Chapter 3] 2.3.4.4 Small Intestine 2.3.4.5 Colon Scientists have known since Pasteur times that our bodies and environment are awash in other species, microbial bystanders that seem to grow everywhere. But the techniques for uncovering which organisms are where and what they are doing was revolutionized in the first decade of the 2000s by those new-fangled gene sequencers that were so usefully applied to human genes. The old technique for studying the microbial life around us required taking a sample, inserting it into a culture of some nutrient broth known to be good for breeding microbes, and waiting a few days to see what grows (or doesn’t). That’s still a common way to study microbes, and that couple-of-day incubation period is one reason you don’t get your lab tests back for a few days. Now, thanks to new machines originally developed for mass DNA sequencing, the process of finding and understanding microbes has been revolutionized. It’s now possible to search for new life forms without growing them in a culture, and this has made possible a major shift in how to think about life —and what is important and special about human hardware. Unlike the genetic discoveries you can make by understanding your DNA (from a low-cost consumer service like 23andme), much of the news from the microbial world is actionable. There’s little, if anything, you can do if you find you have a particular type of gene that gives you, say, a propensity to alzheimers for example. But because the microbes around you are constantly changing anyway, and because you can influence which ones grow and which don’t, the world of the human micro biome is eminently actionable.

["explore-your-microbiome.html", "Chapter 3 Explore Your Microbiome 3.1 How to Use the uBiome Taxonomy Files 3.2 Comparing samples", " Chapter 3 Explore Your Microbiome Your first step is to get some data. The most popular laboratory is a San Francisco startup called uBiome, that originally began as crowdfunded campaign on Indiegogo16, but has since handled tens of thousands of samples from people like me who are curious to know what a 16S analysis will reveal about their own microbiome. For less than $100, you send them a sample and a few weeks later they give you access to a private web page that will show you a breakdown of the types of bacteria they found. 3.1 How to Use the uBiome Taxonomy Files The information you see in the uBiome web app is a greatly simplified view of the data torrent that comes from the gene sequencing machines that crunched your sample. Your raw data can be thousands of lines long, so to be more useful, uBiome provides a much more concise version. It’s called a “taxonomy” file, which is generally only a few hundred lines showing just the organisms that the uBiome computer algorithms think they found in your sample. Because uBiome JSON files are well-structured, it’s easy to process them with other software, including Excel. That’s our next step: bring this data into Excel. 3.1.1 Study your results in Excel 3.1.2 Converting uBiome taxonomy JSON to Excel If you just have one or two files, it’s easy to bring uBiome taxonomy data into Excel. Go to the uBiome Explorer page and click on the section labeled “Advanced” and then “Downloads”: You’ll see a page of JSON representing what uBiome found in your sample. On a desktop computer, if you select-all (press control-A or command-A) then you can copy this data to the clipboard to prepare to paste it to another web site. There are many web sites that will convert JSON to a format that will work in Excel. Google “Json to Excel” or “Json to CSV” and you’ll find one. Just paste your data into one of those sites to convert it for either Excel’s native XLS or XLSX format, or the more universal CSV format, readable by Excel. Here are a few of the sites I’ve tested: http://www.convertcsv.com/json-to-csv.htm http://www.json-xls.com/json2xls Once the data is in Excel, you can work with it just as you would with any Excel data sheet. Here’s how one of my recent uBiome taxonomy files looks in Mac Excel: Yours may look slightly different. Labels may be slightly different sometimes, and the ordering of the columns may be different depending on how the JSON was converted, but none of that matters. The key is that you are now able to work with it in a full-blown spreadsheet. 3.1.3 JSON files The taxonomy files come in a simple structured text format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), commonly used across the web. Although it’s not as convenient for people as the rest of the uBiome web site, programmers refer to JSON as “human readable”, because if you squint enough you can sorta tell what it means without a computer program. Here’s a sample: { &quot;ubiome_bacteriacounts&quot;: [{ &quot;taxon&quot;: &quot;2&quot;, &quot;parent&quot;: &quot;131567&quot;, &quot;count&quot;: &quot;22691&quot;, &quot;count_norm&quot;: &quot;1000000&quot;, &quot;avg&quot;: null, &quot;tax_name&quot;: &quot;Bacteria&quot;, &quot;tax_rank&quot;: &quot;superkingdom&quot;, &quot;tax_color&quot;: null }, { &quot;taxon&quot;: &quot;1239&quot;, &quot;parent&quot;: &quot;2&quot;, &quot;count&quot;: &quot;15414&quot;, &quot;count_norm&quot;: &quot;679300&quot;, &quot;avg&quot;: null, &quot;tax_name&quot;: &quot;Firmicutes&quot;, &quot;tax_rank&quot;: &quot;phylum&quot;, &quot;tax_color&quot;: &quot;5E6591&quot; } JSON is just structured data. That’s it: a big bunch of lookup keys and values. The keys are unique identifiers and the values are their values. The whole file looks that way. The only requirement of a JSON file is that it be precisely consistent with this pattern, because after all it will need to be read by a computer eventually. The uBiome Taxonomy JSON files identify the key uBiome_bacteriacounts which is mapped to a bunch of fields, each representing a particular organism found in your sample. Look at the figure above to get the basic idea. 3.1.4 The uBiome data tags Let’s review the meaning of each of the columns, which are derived from the following uBiome JSON keys: count: an absolute measure of number of organisms found in the sample. Without knowing the size of the sample, or how many times the DNA inside was processed through PCR amplification, this number doesn’t mean much except in relation to other counts at the same taxonomical rank. count_norm: a “normalized” version of the count, created by simply dividing the count on a given row by the count found on the row with tax_name = Bacteria and then multiplying by one million. It’s easier to just think of it as parts per million: each unit is 1 / 10,000th of a percent. For example, if you see a row with count_norm = 500,000, you can just think of that as 50% of the sample. tax_name: this is the classification of the organism based on the level of its taxonomy. If you were looking at a human being, for example, you would see homo sapiens if you selected tax_rank = species, but you’d see mammalia if you selected tax_rank = class. tax_rank: tells the level of the taxonomy. In daily conversation about animals or plants, we usually refer to the species \\(e.g. homo sapiens\\), but sometimes it’s more useful to talk about bigger groupings of related organisms. For example, humans are members of the class mammalia, along with tigers and horses. If this spreadsheet were counting organisms at the level of class mammalia, the count_norm would almost certainly be bigger than the count_norm for humans alone, unless humans were the only type of mammal found in the sample. taxon and parent: these help identify the ranking in a more precise way by pointing out which tax_ranks are subsets of which. For example, Bacteroidia above has a parent = 976, meaning that it is a subset of the taxon 976, Bacteroidetes. When you follow the various taxons and parents up the chain, you’ll see they all end in the superkingdom Bacteria, which has a taxon of 2. The values for these numbers, incidentally, are taxonomical numbers from the curated database at NCBI, the national bioinformatics center run by the U.S. government. Enter the number into the taxonomy browser at the NCBI Taxonomy Browser and you can learn as much as you want about that organism. tax_color doesn’t matter for this anaysis, but uBiome software uses this to colorize their pretty graphs to make them more readable. Of these fields, the most important ones are tax_name, tax_rank, and count_norm. 3.2 Comparing samples The uBiome JSON taxonomy file is extremely helpful at giving you a short summary of what you care about most in a sample: the organisms within it and their relative amounts. But even with these annotations, there’s a limit to what you can learn in a single sample. To be able to start hacking your microbiome, you will need to learn how to compare multiple samples. There are two main things you’ll want to measure when comparing two samples: Uniqueness: which organisms are found in only one sample and not the other? If you are comparing two samples from the same individual \\(e.g. Yourself\\), then uniqueness is another way of talking about either extinctions \\(when a taxon has disappeared entirely in a later sample\\) and appearances \\(when a new taxon magically shows up\\). In other words, you care a lot about the order in which the samples were taken. On the other hand, if you’re comparing two separate individuals, then the ordering of the samples doesn’t matter. Uniqueness just tells which organisms are unique to a specific person. Relative abundance: which person has more of which organism? There are two senses in which we care about the relative frequency of an organism’s occurrence in a sample. You might care, among all the taxons found, which ones are more highly represented in absolute amounts? Or you might care on a relative basis. To help understand why this matters, it may help to think of the following specific example: In many Americans the phylum Firmicutes makes up a majority of the sample, often reaching 60% or more. You might find two people, one who has 60% Firmicutes and the other with 30% — only half as much. The relative difference is 2x and the absolute difference is 30 percentage points. On the other hand, you might find Bifidobacterium makes up 10% of the first sample and 5% of the second. In this case, the relative difference is 2x — just like the Firmicutes case — but the absolute difference is only 5 percentage points, much less than in the first example. The built-in uBiome web tools look for relative differences. A taxon might be a minuscule component of both samples, but when you start from a small base, even a few additional organisms can make up a big percentage change. In the extreme case, a sample with a count_norm of 100 compared to another sample with a count_norm of 300 will show a 3X increase — very high in aBiome terms, even though the absolute difference is only 300 - 100 = 200 organisms. Compare that with a an organism with a count_norm of 50,000 in one sample and 51,000 in another sample. UBiome’s algorithms will treat these as a virtual tie, even though the absolute number of organisms in the second sample outnumber the first by 1,000 organisms. Which method of measuring is better? It depends on what you care more about. Some species need only a tiny representation in a sample to make a big difference in health outcomes. I prefer to use both methods of measurement: absolute number changes for the most popular taxons, and relative amounts more for the less-popular ones. 3.2.1 Make a single sheet with all your samples I often read news about a fresh scientific discovery involving the microbiome and immediately wonder if the discovery applies to me. For example, I recently saw a study from Oregon State University that seemed to find a link between high sugar diets and “cognitive flexibility”, i.e. your ability to adapt and adjust to changing circumstances. The study’s author, Kathy Magnusson, a professor in the OSU College of Veterinary Medicine, found that mice who eat lots of sugar have elevated levels of Clostridiales bacteria, and that this seemed to relate to a slower ability to solve a maze. Hmmm, I thought — how much Clostridiales do I have? If you have just one uBiome result, that’s easy: log into http://explorer.ubiome.com and search for it in the section “All My Bacteria”. But in my experience a single result doesn’t tell you much. You really need at least two and hopefully several uBiome results to see what might be actionable. In my case, I want to know how my Clostridiales may have changed over time. I programmed a short Python script to generate a single Excel table with every bacteria I’ve ever found, and then a series of columns with the amount found in each sample. Something like this: The data makes it easy to generate a chart showing how my Clostridiales changes over time: Hmmm, in my case it looks like something happened since last fall to increase my Clostridiales levels. Maybe it was the potato starch I tried in order to hack my sleep? Was it my trip to Central America in February? And of course the biggest question: has the increase affected my cognitive flexibility? I’m not really sure. Whatever happened, the level of Clostridiales seems to have stabilized in the past couple of months. uBiome has identified more than 900 unique taxa (groups of organisms) in the half-dozen samples I’ve submitted over the past year, and after running this script I have them all laid out on a single page. Now, armed with this one spreadsheet I can search anytime for a new microbe and quickly see if I have it now, or if it’s ever been detected in a previous test. Reading news about microbiome has taken on a whole new personal meaning when I can see if the discovery relates to me. If you know a little Python, you can make the same spreadsheet with your samples using the ubiome.py Python module on the ubiome-opensource GitHub repository; the script that generated my spreadsheet is there too as an example. And while you’re at it, please upload your own uBiome sample results to the same repository so we can compare. https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ubiome-sequencing-your-microbiome#/↩ "],
["experiments-i-have-tried.html", "Chapter 4 Experiments I have tried 4.1 How kefir changes the microbiome", " Chapter 4 Experiments I have tried Microbe numbers shift daily in response to your environment, so a single sample won’t give much more than a broad introduction to the basics of your microbiome. To understand the results of a given test, you’ll soon want to compare it to other samples, either from yourself at a different point in time, or to other people. This chapter will give examples for how to do that. How Kefir changes the microbiome Experiment 1: Food Can I learn anything if carefully record all the food I ate between two tests a week apart? Experiment 2: Travel I tested myself before and after a trip to Central America, and while traveling in Mexico. What changed? Experiment 3: Hacking My Sleep Can I improve my sleep by feeding the right microbes? Experiment 4: The Dentist What changes before and after my dental checkup? Experiment 5: Gut Cleanse Let’s go all the way: clear out all the microbes and watch how they grow back. 4.1 How kefir changes the microbiome If you follow the microbiome at all, you’ll eventually discover the benefits of kefir. Google the phrase “one of the most potent probiotic foods available” and you’ll find kefir in all the top results. A recent BBC documentary that tested people after consuming different types of “gut-friendly” foods found that kefir had by far the biggest effect. My interest piqued when, after my disappointment with kombucha, I spoke with a man who happened to mention his good luck with kefir as a solution to his many gut issues. On a doctor’s recommendation, he tried kefir for a number of years with limited success, until — frustrated with the $3/day expense of buying it at Trader Joe’s — he began making it himself at home. “What a difference!” he claimed. Let’s jump to the conclusion: I tried it myself and it’s true. I found a very noticeable change in my gut microbiome — the most significant I’ve seen among my many experiments. Look at my levels of Lactococcus, the main genus of microbe known to be found in kefir: You’ll note that I had none of this microbe until late January, when I started to drink kefir. The two dips after that, one in mid-March and another in early-April, coincide with trips out of town when I was not able to drink my kefir regularly. So it apparently has a big effect on the microbiome. What is this stuff anyway? The first thing to know about kefir is the pronunciation. Say “Keh-FEAR”, with the accent on the second syllable, not “KEE-fur” or “kEH-fir”. The Russian origin of the term is a reminder of a time in the distant past when — it’s unclear exactly where or how — the first batch was prepared and then passed along, its microbial components shared from person to person until it reached today’s status as a popular drink you can buy in most grocery stores. Making it at home brings more benefits than just saving money. Commercially-purchased drinks are subject to unavoidable regulatory, shelf-life, and consistency contraints that are important for business. But more than that, if you believe like I do that microbes are highly-customized to our environments, making at home will ensure that the kefir is well-adapted to your own personal microbial environment. The batch that survives and thrives in your kitchen will, by definition, have proven its ability to withstand whatever whatever conditions you face there. Making it yourself is surprisingly easy. It begins with a bundle of the component microbes, a cauliflower-shaped substance usually called the “grain” or “seed”. Instruction books often tell you to be careful how you handle the grains, but I find them robust enough that I pick them up with my bare fingers. I drop them into a glass of milk left sitting on the counter overnight and — voila! — twenty four hours later, the liquid has turned into kefir. Pull out the kefir grains from that glass, plop it into another, and you’re all set for tomorrow’s batch. Unlike yogurt, which requires heating and a stable temperature, kefir doesn’t appear to care about how it’s handled, so long as you keep it at room temperature and can wait for twenty four hours. The reaction might vary by a few hours if the room is a bit colder or warmer, but otherwise I find it surprisingly consistent. Just set and forget. The ease with which the kefir fermentation happens today begs the question of how the very first kefir grains were created. Nobody knows exactly, but there are people who make them from scratch. I haven’t tried this myself, but apparently a goat-hide bag filled with pasteurized milk and the intestinal flora of a sheep will do, so long as you shake every hour and maintain a constant temperature. Even without going the goat-hide route, I found that getting started was the only hard part of the process. You can order some starter grains online for under $25, but to survive shipping the manufacturers generally give them to you in a freeze-dried form that requires a week or so of preparation before the microbes are fully alive and kicking out drinkable quantities of kefir. I got mine by asking around until I found a neighbor who had been brewing his own. Anyone who makes homemade kefir will be happy to give you some extra grains. The fermentation process causes the grains to multiply, and you will find yourself throwing them out regularly. The grains themselves contain a combination of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc), acetic acid bacteria, and yeast, clumped together with casein (milk proteins) and complex sugars in a matrix of a unique polysaccharide called Kefiran. The nutritional content apparently varies depending on fermentation time and other factors, but there’s a lot of good stuff in there. One study shows the following: A rigorous microbial analysis by an Irish lab recently showed precisely which microbes are present in kefir, at various stages in the fermentation process. This chart shows the composition of ordinary pasteurized milk as it changes from before adding kefir grains (time 0 at the bottom) until 24 hours have passed (top) and the milk has been transformed into just Acetobacter, Lactobacillus, and Leuconostoc. The uBiome test looks only at the 16S ribosomal gene, which unfortunately can’t detect yeasts, so I don’t have an easy way to track the yeasts in the kefir. Kombucha "],
["caseStudies.html", "Chapter 5 Case Studies 5.1 Father and son 5.2 Case study: a baby microbiome 5.3 Alzheimers and the microbiome", " Chapter 5 Case Studies Let’s look at some specific examples: 5.1 Father and son My father and I live in different parts of the country: he’s in the Midwest (where I grew up) and I’m on the West Coast. We’re both healthy omnivores and, other than a couple-decade age difference we both eat roughly similar foods and have similar medical histories. That said, I was surprised to see our gut biomes were so similar. Here’s how I did the comparison. Remember that a gut microbiome varies a lot day-to-day, depending on whatever food we happened to eat, exposure to illness, geographic location, even time of year. To keep the variables as constant as possible, I’ll compare two samples taken on the same day: 74847 76580 Firmicutes 53.8212 46.4356 Bacteroidetes 19.8016 37.5014 Verrucomicrobia 16.8042 2.4382 Proteobacteria 1.7949 12.4340 Actinobacteria 6.6491 0.9072 Euryarchaeota 4.7835 0.0209 At the highest, phylum, level, we can see the percentage abundances look different, but not terribly different. One easy way to spot specific patterns is through a heatmap, like this one: 5.2 Case study: a baby microbiome Molly is a healthy infant whose first-time parents are interested in the microbiome and have tried to do everything they can to optimize their baby’s microbial health. Molly was born vaginally, has never had antibiotics, is exclusively breast-fed by a mother who tries to eat nutritious, organic food. They live in the country, surrounded by nature, including pets and other animals that will become more of her life when she starts to move around. But how can you tell whether their healthy lifestyle is helping? To find out, her parents gave Molly an $89 uBiome gut kit for her one-month birthday. As any parent on diaper duty knows, collecting the, um, sample is pretty easy. They mailed a tiny swab to the lab and a few weeks later they received this list of the kinds of bacteria found along with a breakdown of their percentage abundances: Phylum (Baby) Bacteroidetes 84.59% Actinobacteria 9.18% Proteobacteria 3.97% Firmicutes 2.26% What does this all mean? Well, the first thing to notice about Molly’s microbiome is the dominance of a group of bacteria called Bacteroidetes, and the much lower levels of another type called Firmicutes. In most westerners, the abundance of these two is exactly reversed, as you can see in a similar breakdown we have of Molly’s mom: Phylum (Mom) Firmicutes 50.40% Bacteroidetes 23.04% Verrucomicrobia 8.66% Actinobacteria 7.78% Proteobacteria 1.59% Nitrospirae 0.02% Figure 2: Mom’s microbiome The bacterial kingdom is extremely old and diverse, much more so than the other types of living things around us. The categories Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are therefore very broad, a bit like discussing “vertebrates” and lumping in everything from fish to people as one kind of life. Even at this high level, they have some distinctive features – Firmicutes tends to eat fats, whereas Bacteroidetes likes sugars – but to understand the difference between Molly and her mother, let’s dig more deeply into exactly the types of Firmicutes we see. In adults like Molly’s Mom, we generally find that more than 99% of Firmicutes come from a group of inter-related bacteria called Clostridiales. But not Molly’s. Hers is almost entirely a single species, Phascolarctobacterium faecium. What does it do? Without comparing her to other babies, we don’t really know. How little we understand is just one of the frustrating recurring themes as we study the microbiome. The next big bunch in Molly’s gut is Actinobacteria, of which nearly all is a well-studied species called Bifidobacterium longum. This one is so closely associated with good health that many supplement makers sell it as a prebiotic pill, and Molly has enough to fill a factory: it makes up more than 8% of her entire sample, nearly 100 times more than her mother. Bifidobacteria like milk, and Molly’s are fortunate that she is breastfed. One clue about the importance of breast milk to baby microbes is human milk oligosaccharide (HMO), which despite being the most abundant component of milk, after fat and lactose17, has a chemical structure too complex for the baby to digest! Some early designers of infant formula assumed Nature had made a mistake and tried somewhat arrogantly to market their wares as “scientifically” better because it was simple enough for a baby. But HMOs aren’t there to feed the baby; they nourish the abundant microbes in the infant gut, mostly the Bifidobacteria, and later the Bacteroides that will play a role when it comes time for the baby to begin eating solid foods. At that point, Molly’s microbiota will undergo a big transformation until, by three years old, her gut will look like an adult’s. Turning to the other big phyla, Bacteroidetes, we see here too Molly’s is almost exclusively one species: Bacteroides fragilis, of which her mom (but not her dad) has a tiny bit as well. That makes sense because this particular bacterium is a well-known early infant colonizer, transmitted from mother to child. Some Norwegian scientists, surveying the research, noted its well-known immune system modulating properties: B. fragilis are higher in children with high specific IgE (sIgE). IgE plays a central role in asthma and allergy. Other studies have shown a correlation of B. fragilis with asthma and pollen allergy.18 Now that doesn’t mean Molly herself is predisposed to any of these conditions – in fact, it may mean the exact opposite depending on the amounts or the presence or absence of other species. Again, without studying a lot more babies, we just don’t know. Interestingly, when I looked closely at the broadest levels of bacteria, I couldn’t find a single phylum of microbes that was present in Molly but not in her parents, while I found plenty of examples of the opposite. I guess that’s one more way Molly is dependent on her mommy. Bottle-fed babies, by the way, tend to have more diversity; though my guess is those extra bacteria aren’t all good. One microbe that doesn’t appear in Molly’s sample is Lactobacillus, which is often missing in collicky babies19. Fortunately, Molly seems completely normal for now but this is something to watch for in future tests. There may be an easy fix anyway: get her a sibling. Babies who grow up in homes with other small children tend to have better microbiomes.20 Thanks to the surging interest in gut health, many parents are taking steps to ensure their babies have the best possible microbiome, but until the recent development of low-cost test kits, it was difficult to tell how well it was working. Now Molly’s parents have a new tool, and if you’re changing diapers regularly anyway, why not test your own baby too and share your results with others so that we can all learn more and contribute to the scientific understanding of the baby biome. 5.3 Alzheimers and the microbiome “Anne” is a 40-year-old mother with a secret: her 23andme genetic test results show she is homozygous for the APOE-4 variant, which in slightly-misleading-but-you-know-what-I-mean everyday language means she has the gene for Alzheimer’s disease. Statistics show that about 80% of people like her will develop the condition, and with this particular gene variant, it’s likely she may start to see early symptoms as soon as age 50. Scary! No wonder she doesn’t want anyone to know, including her children and relatives. But Anne is also an optimist: she prefers to see herself as one of the 20% with the gene who won’t develop any symptoms. And she’s ready and motivated to do whatever necessary — diet, exercise, lifestyle changes — to beat this thing. She also knows that her body includes much more than human DNA, that for every human gene like that APOE-4 variant, she is host to as many as ten or a hundred times as many microbial genes, including — perhaps — some that with a bit of nurturing might help offset or prevent whatever propensity her human DNA has to this terrible disease. Scientists researching Alzheimer’s disease have uncovered some intriguing relationships with the microbiome. (see this recent New York Times article for a summary.) Some early AD symptoms, like a loss of smell, may be clues that the brain has been attacked by something that came from outside. The microbiome of the mouth, especially, is an excellent hiding place for low-grade infectious agents thanks to its many dark corners with regular access to both the inside and outside of the body. After reading about these relationships, Anne recently submitted an oral sample to uBiome and shared the results with me. Important caveat before we go further: uBiome kit results are intended for scientific research only. The science of the microbiome is too new to make definitive healthcare-related decisions, and uBiome kits have not been evaluated or approved by regulators. If you are sick, or you need medical guidance, always see a doctor. I am not a doctor! The AD research field has blossomed lately with the realization that the brain, once thought to be completely sterile, is home to many microbes. This discovery and additional research has excited the editors of the respected Journal of Alzheimers Disease, who concluded a recent issue (2016): \\[W\\]e propose that infectious agents, including HSV1, Chlamydia pneumonia, and spirochetes, reach the CNS (Central Nervous System) and remain there in latent form. These agents can undergo reactivation in the brain during aging, as the immune system declines…The consequent neuronal damage… occurs recurrently, leading to (or acting as a cofactor for) progressive synaptic dysfunction, neuronal loss, and ultimately Alzheimers Disease. That’s a powerful indictment of specific microbes, and the article calls them out by name. So does Anne have any in her uBiome sample? Unfortunately, here’s where we see both the promise and the limitations of uBiome and others who suspect the microbiome will play an important role in eventually conquering this terrible disease. The promise is intriguing: if we could identify the specific microbes underlying the condition, and then, perhaps through antibiotics or probiotics or some other intervention, what if we could get rid of the “bad” microbes and reseed with the “good” ones? Here’s a high-level (phylum) look at Anne’s oral microbiome: Firmicutes 41.10% Proteobacteria 37.42% Bacteroidetes 12.55% Fusobacteria 5.19% Actinobacteria 3.69% Candidatus Saccharibacteria 0.08% Spirochaetes 0.01% Tenericutes 0.00% Careful readers will immediately notice the Spirochaetes – the same name identified as a suspect in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Research. Is this just a coincidence?! Or have we found a link? At this point, (big groan), we know there are quick-buck charlatans out there who will seize on an observation like this to sell hope to Alzheimer’s sufferers and their families: how about a new anti-Spirochetes supplement? A seven-step “detox” plan to permanently rid your system of Spirochetes? Great idea for a new business, or maybe a best-selling book, right? At uBiome, we’re very serious about science, and part of our mission is to promote citizen science because we believe in the power of normal people like Anne to participate and drive the discoveries that will revolutionize medicine of the future. We’re excited about those possibilities, but unfortunately there are no shortcuts, and real conclusions from this data are still a ways away. It turns out that Spirochaetes is actually quite common in the oral microbiome. It’s a broad category of free-moving bacteria that like to hide in low-oxygen environments. Its most infamous members include the genus Troponema, associated with syphilis, which come to think of it is a disease that affects the brain. (In botany class they like to joke that it’s called spirochete because that’s what you get when you cheat). The Spirochaetes in Anne’s test results are not Troponema, but even if they were it wouldn’t mean much. A lot of people have these. I have some in my own mouth microbiome. The ecology of the mouth is so rich and complex that it’s almost never possible to identify something as either “bad” or “good”. My favorite example is “viridans” streptococci: a species that live peacefully in most people’s mouths unless somehow they end up in the bloodstream, where they are a leading cause of heart valve infections. Sounds awful until you realize that when these same bacteria come in contact with other streptococci, like the pathogen behind strep throat, the viridans always win: they hog all the food and beat back the strep. Now is that a “good” bug or a “bad” one? The answer is that it depends. The same is likely to be true about whatever microbes might be involved with Alzheimer’s. But the good news is that our kits can still play a big role in helping to narrow down the microbes that are different in people who go on to develop the disease. If we can collect enough samples from people like Anne, who have a family history and are at high risk for AD, we can compare them to one another as well as to thousands of samples of people who are normal risk and maybe we’ll see a pattern. For example, when Anne compared her mouth biome results with those from a close relative, she found that she has these unique phyla. The relative does not have them: Anne’s Unique Phyla % diff Candidatus Saccharibacteria 0.08% Spirochaetes 0.01% Tenericutes 0.00% Interestingly, this relative has none of her Spirochaetes. And we find two others missing as well. Do they matter? Who knows? The microbiome studies that have been conducted so far on AD patients are too limited to offer suggestions for what Anne can do right now, but slight differences like this offer her some ideas for possible experiments in the meantime. Anne already follows the general advice that doctors give to everyone, including those at risk of AD, who wants a healthy microbiome: get plenty of exercise and sleep, eat healthy unprocessed foods, and avoid antibiotics. But, just possibly, there are variations on these general good habits that might help her today. For example, she’s experimenting with different toothpastes to see how that affects her mouth microbiome. Did you know that most of the common toothpaste brands include powerful antibiotics? Could the difference in brand be responsible for the unique phyla she sees? To learn more about herself, she’s experimenting with alternate brands – testing her oral microbiome before and after to see the effects. This is not the end of the story. Sadly we don’t know what will ultimately happen to Anne. But through better knowledge of herself, and her microbiome, she’s doing everything she can to beat the odds.

It takes up to 500 calories per day for a mother to produce enough breastmilk to feed a child (pregnancy takes only an extra 300), so nature is apparently very serious about getting this right.↩ Bjerke, G A, R Wilson, O Storrø, T Øyen, R Johnsen, and K Rudi. 2011. “Mother-to-Child Transmission of and Multiple-Strain Colonization by Bacteroides Fragilis in a Cohort of Mothers and Their Children.” Applied and Environmental Microbiology 77 (23): 8318–24. doi:10.1128/AEM.05293-11.↩ de Weerth, C., S.

["next.html", "Chapter 6 Go Further 6.1 Fermented Food 6.2 My favorite books about the microbiome 6.3 Best Academic Papers 6.4 Other Resources", " Chapter 6 Go Further Once you’ve appreciated the importance of the microbiome and its affect on health and more, you may want to expand your knowledge beyond the scope of this book. 6.1 Fermented Food Here are a few things to try: Fermented and pickled food Raw milk People have been fermenting food since the distant past, making everything from beer to cheese. Fermentation is an ideal way to preserve food beyond the date at which it is practical to eat. Fermenting your own foods is surprisingly easy. 6.1.1 Yogurt One of the easiest ferments is home-made yogurt. Pour a few cups of whole milk into a saucepan and heat to not-quite-boiling. You’ll need to get it above 160 degrees, the temperature that kills bacteria in milk, but if it goes all the way to boiling the milk will taste scalded. Even that’s not the end of the world, but you may as well try to keep it under that. Use a kitchen thermometer the first few times if you like, but soon you’ll be able to tell intuitively because you’ll see steam rising from the surface of the milk, but no boiling bubbles. After the milk has been heated, remove and pour it into a glass bowl. Let it sit until it cools to about 110 degrees. Here, a kitchen thermometer is more useful, especially the first time because the exact temperature is more important. Warmer than 110 degrees and the lactobacillus yogurt bacteria will die; too much lower and they won’t grow. Once you have the hang of it, you’ll be able to tell based on the touch: it’ll feel unpleasantly warmer than your hand (which should be 98 degrees) but not too warm to touch. Once the milk hits that rough temperature zone, pour in a tiny amount of yogurt from another source. This is called the “starter” yogurt and the best is to use a bit of leftover from your previous batch, but for your first attempt you can use any commercially-purchased yogurt. Sweetened, flavored, non-fat — any kind is okay as long as it has live cultures in it. Be sure not to use too much yogurt. Definitely no more than a tablespoon, and perhaps even just a teaspoon or two. Because of the small amounts, you’ll be tempted to think you need more, but in this case more is definitely not better. Too much starter will suffocate the mixture. Whenever I’ve had an unsuccessful batch it’s almost always due to having too much starter. Mix the starter thoroughly into the lukewarm milk and then cover it up and put it someplace warm. The key is to keep the mixture close to that magical 110 degree point. Some people put it overnight in an oven set to the lowest temperature, but if you don’t like running the oven overnight you can try wrapping it tightly with something that will retain the heat through the night. If have a high-quality thermos-style cooler, you can set it inside there, and some people cover it with thick towels and set it in the warmest part of the house. Another option is to use a heating pad, set to the lowest setting and placed underneath the bowl. The important thing is to keep the mixture at the warm temperatures that the bacteria need in order to breed. Set in a quiet place for about 8-10 hours. Overnight is ideal. When you open the bowl again, you’ll find the mixture no longer resembles milk, but has been transformed into a much thicker consistency — a yogurt. It will taste sour, and if you’re not accustomed to plain, unsweetened yogurt you may even think that is has spoiled. Nope, that’s just how pure, real yogurt is meant to taste. 6.1.2 Pickling The next step after yogurt-making is also easy. It takes a little longer, from one to several weeks, but lets you expand your fermentation skills to many more foods. The most basic one is cabbage, to make your own sauerkraut. Think of fermentation as a type of farming, only instead of large plants that you see, you’re farming with invisible microbes. In both cases the object is to start with a small seed that grows into a full crop. For sauerkraut, the microbes are naturally occurring on the leaves of plants and vegetables. You just need to put them into the right environment so the microbes can grow. Start with a small head of cabbage and a grater. If you don’t have a grater, then just chop it into small pieces. Cabbage is already covered with tiny microbes, but the interesting ones will not reproduce in the presence of oxygen; you need to get them out of the air. The best way to do that is to submerge them in a liquid — in this case we’ll use the naturally occurring water inside the cabbage leaves themselves. The purpose of grating or chopping is simply to let the water escape from the leaves until it covers the entire mixture. You’ll need some type of container to submerge the leaves. Best is something made of glass or ceramic, though any container is fine as long as it doesn’t react with the acids that will be produced by the microbes. A standard mason jar works, for example, or even a cleaned-out jar of pasta sauce. Make sure you have a lid for the container, and make sure the lid doesn’t close too tightly. If you use something with a screw-top lid (like a pasta sauce jar) just pop a few tiny holes in the lid. The microbes will be producing carbon dioxide as they ferment, and you’ll need a way for the gases to leave or the container will explode. Begin packing the cabbage leaves into the container as tightly as possible. While doing this, most people add some salt. The salt serves two purposes; it adds flavor, and it helps draw more water out of the plant. Just a small amount of salt is enough: about what you would use if you were seasoning it for flavor: a few shakes on each cabbage leaf as you peel it is enough, or maybe a total of a tablespoon or two for a small head of cabbage. Continue to pile more leaves into the container until it is full. If you’re doing everything correctly, there will be a nice layer of liquid that completely covers the leaves in the container. Remember that the microbes can’t reproduce if there is air, so covering with liquid is essential. If you see any green leaves poking out of the liquid, pack them down further. It may help to find an insert of some kind to place directly over the leaves, perhaps anthe lid to a smaller sized jar, one that fits inside the container and lets you squish the leaves even tighter. The key is to keep everything submerged in liquid. Put as many cabbage leaves as you can into the container and close the lid, but be careful: the bacteria in the jar will soon start to produce carbon dioxide gas, which will put pressure on the container. That’s the reason for the air holes you poked in the lid beforehand. You may want to cover the entire jar with a loose-fitting piece of cellophane, or an old cloth, as a precaution in case the aroma begins to attract insects. That’s it! Leave the fermenting jar in a cool, undisturbed place and then check on it for the first few days. Make sure the liquid has entirely submerged the cabbage leaves. Within a day or two you’ll also notice some air bubbles in the liquid — the sign that the fermentation has begun to work. Now, just let the jar rest for another several days or more. The longer it sits, the more acidic it will become. If you like a sour taste, let it sit for a week or two, maybe even up to a month or more. If you want a more subtle flavor, take it out in a few days. Feel free to sniff the jar every day or two to decide when you think it’s ready. When finished, it will look and smell like sauerkraut. If some of the leaves were not entirely submerged in liquid, it’s possible that a layer of moldy fungus has appeared, unsightly but not a problem. Just scrape off whatever doesn’t look like sauerkraut and eat the rest. 6.1.3 What’s happening in sauerkraut The transformation from cabbage leaves to sauerkraut happens thanks to a complex interaction of bacteria starting with some members of the Leuconostoc species that occur naturally on the cabbage leaves. These are anaerobic organisms — they can’t live in oxygen. When submerged in the cabbage liquid, however, they thrive, consuming all the sugars they can find and converting them to lactic acid, giving off carbon dioxide as a byproduct. You’ll know the reaction is occurring when you spot tiny bubbles at the surface of the liquid a few hours after beginning the reaction. Sadly for the Leuconostoc, they are too good at what they do. Eventually they’ll consume all of the sugars they find transforming the liquid into a sour concoction, and as result the environment turns too acidic for them and they die. By then, the conditions have become ideal for another species, lactobacillus, which was pretty much designed for acidic liquids, and they finish off the remaining sugars, until the acidic level reaches PH=3, at which point their work is done. Fortunately for humans, the pathogens that could cause us harm are unable to survive in this high-acidic environment, and would be out-competed by the existing microbes anyway, so the final mixture is perfectly healthy. 6.1.4 More fermentation Just about any food can be fermented, as people in all cultures have known since pre-history. Many common ethnic foods, such as miso (soybean) or kimchee (cabbage), are possible only thanks to fermentation. When you eat “cured” bacon or sausage, you are eating something that resulted from a complex interaction between microbes and meat.

If you’re a newcomer who would like to come up to speed, here’s my ranked list of the best books as of today (November 2016). 6.2.1 Knight, Rob Follow Your Gut: How the Ecosystem in Your Gut Determines Your Health, Mood, and More &lt;!- –&gt; At only 120 pages, this is the most concise summary of what’s known — and not known — about the microbiome. Written by one of the scientists behind the American Gut Project, it’s a readable and fascinating overview of the facts and a great first introduction. If you only read one book, this is it. 6.2.2 Sonnenburg, Justin The Good Gut: Taking Control of Your Weight, Your Mood, and Your Long-term Health Another concise, well-written summary by a top-notch researcher. This one ties for first place because, well, I’m a fan of uBiome and this one doesn’t focus on American Gut. The science is first-rate, but there is practical advice too, including an appendix of microbiome-friendly recipes. Spector, Tim The Diet Myth: Why the Secret to Health and Weight Loss is Already in Your Gut Another excellent one written by a practicing scientist and a good complement to Follow Your Gut. The author’s concise writing style packs multiple interesting examples and facts on each page. Divided into chapters based on type of food, I learned about what’s proven and what’s unknown about the effects of different diets on health. Collen, Alanna 10% Human: How Your Body’s Microbes Hold the Key to Health and Happiness Another great overview that explains to the ordinary person the implications of the microbiome. Well-written, full of interesting facts, but sticks strictly to mainstream science. For example, although the author explains the concept of “leaky gut”, she observes it skeptically as an unproven hypothesis, rather than jump whole-hog into diagnoses. Best parts discuss the gut role on behavior (“Mind Control”), with detailed examples from autism research, Whipple’s Disease, and more. The book includes a list of the highest-quality references, but unfortunately it’s not complete, so many of the facts are hard to follow up. Blaser,Martin Missing Microbes: How the Overuse of Antibiotics Is Fueling Our Modern Plagues Velasquez-Manoff, Moises An Epidemic of Absence: A New Way of Understanding Allergies and Autoimmune Diseases Another book that explains a provocative idea that our immune systems need regular stimulation by parasites and other infectious agents, or we risk unpleasant side effects in the form of allergies, diabetes, and many other nasty conditions. The remarkable correlation between the hygiene of modernity and the rise of autoimmune diseases makes for powerful evidence that science is far behind in understanding all the consequences of our current lifestyles. Lustgarten, Michael Infectious Burden: The Cause Of Aging And Age-Related Disease Short, practical summary of what’s known about microbial infections, with suggestions for how to manage and treat them. I liked the chapters on the mouth and skin, with practical advice about how to choose toothpaste and soap. Spector, Tim Identically Different: Why We Can Change Our Genes Well-written, concise overview of what’s known about epigenetics and “Fat Genes”, “Gay Genes”, “Infidelity Genes”, “Bacteria Genes” and more. This is the same author of The Diet Myth discussed above, written before he became aware of the microbiome. 6.2.3 Other Books Worth Having in the Pile Matthews, Richard The Symbiont Factor: How the Gut Bacteria Microbiome Redefines Health, Disease and Humanity Heavily researched and footnoted (the last hundred pages are references), it’s an overview of the practical side of what’s known about the microbiome. When I’m looking for a short summary of particular conditions (Parkinsons, Alzheimers), I reach for Dr. Matthews book first. My complaint is that it’s written by a clinician, not a scientist or journalist, and it’s hard to tell when he’s writing from opinion (e.g. his rants against GMOs) or whether there’s a real scientific consensus on something (e.g. the role of Bifidobacterium). 6.2.4 Not Recommended Life is short, so to help you be more efficient, here’s a list of books that I think are a waste of time. Mullin, Gerard E. The Gut Balance Revolution: Boost Your Metabolism, Restore Your Inner Ecology, and Lose the Weight for Good! Although Dr. Mullin has been thinking about the microbiome for years, most of this book is about standard alternative diet advice, with references to Omega-6, FODMAPs, Mediterranean Diet, etc. but not really much specific about the microbiome. Don’t waste your money. Kellman, Raphael The Microbiome Diet Includes the typical formulaic suggestions for how to cure a bad microbiome (Remove! Replace! Reinoculate! Repair!) and lots of sweeping, unproven suggestions for what to eat: “Cinnamon balances blood sugar” with absolutely nothing to connect it to the microbiome. There is a nice list of “superfoods” including natural prebiotics like jicama, but again you must take his word for it that this somehow benefits the microbiome. Just google it and save the effort. Gershon, Michael The Second Brain: The Scientific Basis of Gut Instinct and a groundbreaking new understanding of nervous disorders of the stomach and intestine Although this was a ground-breaking classic when first published in the 1990s, much of the information is obsolete thanks to new technologies, especially the new sequencing methods that gave rise to our understanding of the microbiome. The more recent book, Gut by Giulia Enders is a more up-to-date description of the anatomical aspects of the digestive system, though Gershon is still worth reading because of its details as well as its outsized influence since its publication. 6.2.5 Other Just about any new health book from the past few years will touch on the microbiome, but I didn’t find much specifically microbiome-related that was useful or new in books by David Asprey (“The Bulletproof Diet”), Tim Ferriss’ Four Hour Body, or Chris Kresser’s Paleo Code. You may find these books useful for other reasons, like the detailed discussions of specific foods, but you’ll learn little about the microbiome. The Bulletproof Diet, for example, stresses the now-disproven Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio too much. 6.3 Best Academic Papers If you’re new to the microbiome and would like to dig into the academic papers that drive the field, here’s the selection that I consider required reading. Microbiome science is in its infancy, but its enormous potential makes it an environment rich in highly speculative research, often with results that are overturned rapidly with new discoveries. So before you read anything else, I encourage a peek at this 2014 Nature article by Harvard epidemiology professor William P. Hanage: Microbiome science needs a healthy dose of skepticism 6.3.1 Popular Topics You will find several themes repeated regularly in the popular microbiome press 6.3.1.1 The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio The most recent, well-respected review (Walters, Xu, Knight 2014) says flat-out: the ratio changes between normal and obese individuals are not statistically significant overall and therefore should not be considered a general feature distinguishing normal and obese human gut microbiota across populations. Another study (Finucane 2014) goes into deeper statistical detail to conclude the same thing. Walters William A.,Xu Zech and Knight Rob(2014), Meta-analyses of human gut microbes associated with obesity and IBD, FEBS Letters, 588, doi: 10.1016/j.febslet.2014.09.039 Finucane MM, Sharpton TJ, Laurent TJ, Pollard KS (2014) A Taxonomic Signature of Obesity in the Microbiome? Getting to the Guts of the Matter. PLoS ONE 9(1): e84689. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0084689 6.3.1.2 Obesity and the microbiome Although it’s exciting to think that an obesity cure might be found in the microbiome, the most recent review shows that it’s more difficult than originally thought. Sze, Marc A., and Patrick D. Schloss. “Looking for a Signal in the Noise: Revisiting Obesity and the Microbiome.” mBio 7, no. 4 (September 7, 2016): e01018-16. doi:10.1128/mBio.01018-16. 6.3.1.3 “We are only 10% human” It’s a number based on a guess dating from 1977, but finally updated in 2016: Our analysis updates the widely-cited 10:1 ratio, showing that the number of bacteria in our bodies is actually of the same order as the number of human cells. Indeed, the numbers are similar enough that each defecation event may flip the ratio to favor human cells over bacteria. Sender, R., Fuchs, S., &amp; Milo, R. (2016).

Retrieved from http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/01/06/036103.abstract 6.3.1.4 Cure/cause obesity by FMT Several studies in mice hint that an obese microbiome can be transferred to a skinny one and vice versa: Turnbaugh, P. J., Ley, R. E., Mahowald, M. A., Magrini, V., Mardis, E. R., &amp; Gordon, J. I. (2006). An obesity-associated gut microbiome with increased capacity for energy harvest. Nature, 444(7122), 1027–31. http://doi.org/10.1038/nature05414 6.3.1.5 Moving Pictures Here, we present the largest human microbiota time series analysis to date, covering two individuals at four body sites over 396 timepoints. Don’t miss the 30-second Youtube summary. Caporaso, J. G., Lauber, C. L., Costello, E. K., Berg-Lyons, D., Gonzalez, A., Stombaugh, J., … Kelley, S. (2011). Moving pictures of the human microbiome. Genome Biology, 12(5), R50. http://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2011-12-5-r50 6.3.2 Academic Papers When you’re ready to go to the original sources, be careful: there are tens of thousands of studies, many of them contradictory and quickly out of date. Here are the ones I think deserve to be read first. Historic papers (HMG) Population studies (enterotype, population studies) Specific microbes (Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium, etc.) Methods 6.3.3 General Overview A detailed technical review of how scientists study the microbiome, with an emphasis on how to judge the quality of results. This is a good overview for a smart person who wants an introduction to how we know what we know. (full text) Tyler, Andrea D, Michelle I Smith, and Mark S Silverberg. “Analyzing the Human Microbiome: A ‘How To’ Guide for Physicians.” The American Journal of Gastroenterology 109, no. 7 (July 2014): 983–93. doi:10.1038/ajg.2014.73. Here is another one: Young, Vincent B. “The Role of the Microbiome in Human Health and Disease: An Introduction for Clinicians.” BMJ, March 15, 2017, j831. doi:10.1136/bmj.j831. 6.3.4 Historic Papers The final paper describing conclusions of the Human Microbiome Project: Human, T., Project, M., &amp; Figures, S. (2012). Structure, function and diversity of the healthy human microbiome. Nature, 486(7402), 207–14. http://doi.org/10.1038/nature11234 6.3.5 Self-tracking Track as much as you can about two people for an entire year: their diet, physical activity, and microbiome; look for correlations. Conclusion: the microbiome is remarkably stable and quickly recovers to its baseline. The “Methods” section is especially interesting because it goes into detail on how to find interesting statistical results with such complicated data. David, L. A., Materna, A. C., Friedman, J., Campos-Baptista, M. I., Blackburn, M. C., Perrotta, A., … Alm, E. J. (2014). Host lifestyle affects human microbiota on daily timescales. Genome Biology, 15(7), R89. http://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2014-15-7-r89 6.3.6 Diet Looking for a good overview of studies that link various microbes to diet? Portune, Kevin J., Alfonso Benítez-Páez, Eva Maria Gomez Del Pulgar, Victor Cerrudo, and Yolanda Sanz. “Gut Microbiota, Diet and Obesity-Related Disorders - the Good, the Bad and the Future Challenges.” Molecular Nutrition &amp; Food Research, June 2016. doi:10.1002/mnfr.201600252. Here’s another one; see the supplements for details about which foods affect which bacteria. David, Lawrence A., Corinne F. Maurice, Rachel N. Carmody, David B. Gootenberg, Julie E. Button, Benjamin E. Wolfe, Alisha V. Ling, et al. “Diet Rapidly and Reproducibly Alters the Human Gut Microbiome.” Nature 505, no. 7484 (December 11, 2013): 559–63. doi:10.1038/nature12820. 6.3.7 Population studies 6.3.8 Enterotypes The intriguing idea that there may be identifiable patterns in our microbiomes, called enterotypes, was proposed in this highly-cited paper, which includes a detailed methods supplement to show you how to compute it yourself: Arumugam, Manimozhiyan, Jeroen Raes, Eric Pelletier, Denis Le Paslier, Takuji Yamada, Daniel R. Mende, Gabriel R. Fernandes, et al. “Enterotypes of the Human Gut Microbiome.” Nature 473, no. 7346 (May 12, 2011): 174–80. doi:10.1038/nature09944. The idea that identifiable enterotypes may exist has been viewed skeptically in follow-up work. 6.3.9 Large population summaries Twin studies help tease out the different effects of human and microbial DNA. This is a recent update to a study of 1,126 twin pairs: Goodrich, Julia K., Emily R. Davenport, Michelle Beaumont, Matthew A. Jackson, Rob Knight, Carole Ober, Tim D. Spector, Jordana T. Bell, Andrew G. Clark, and Ruth E. Ley. “Genetic Determinants of the Gut Microbiome in UK Twins.” Cell Host &amp; Microbe 19, no. 5 (May 2016): 731–43. doi:10.1016/j.chom.2016.04.017. Two excellent papers present a detailed analysis of the microbiomes and associated phenotypic information from several thousand healthy people in the Belgian Flemish Gut Flora Project (N = 1106) and the Dutch LifeLines-DEEP study (N = 1135). Falony, G., M. Joossens, S. Vieira-Silva, J. Wang, Y. Darzi, K. Faust, A. Kurilshikov, et al. “Population-Level Analysis of Gut Microbiome Variation.” Science 352, no. 6285 (April 29, 2016): 560–64. doi:10.1126/science.aad3503. Zhernakova, A., A. Kurilshikov, M. J.

Be sure to study the supplemental materials, especially Supplement Table 11, which includes details of the specific microbes. 6.3.10 Methods A good overview of the current state of how microbiome analysis is performed, from the sample collection processing, to the data pipeline and final bioinformatics summaries. It includes references to the top platforms (e.g QIME, Mothur, PICRUSt) along with the various tradeoffs of each: Amato, Katherine R. “[An Introduction to Microbiome Analysis for Human Biology Applications](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajhb.22931/full): Amato.” American Journal of Human Biology, October 2016. doi:10.1002/ajhb.22931. 6.4 Other Resources Elizabeth Bik keeps an excellent Microbiome Papers Collection of a few dozen classic academic papers. and you’ll find even more in (Tyler, Smith, and Silverberg 2014), which is strongly recommended.
