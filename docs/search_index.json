["preface.html", "Preface", " Preface Good books about the microbiome are everywhere, and if that’s what you want, you should skip right now to my own recommended list. Many people, more knowledgable than I will ever be, have summarized the science more eloquently and accurately than I can. That’s not what this book is about. Instead, this is a summary of my attempt through self-experiments to figure out for myself what works and what doesn’t. The science of the microbiome boasts many spectacular claims, often justified, and I started with the assumption that new technologies make it possible for any curious person to study the science directly, to separate the truth from the hype, and to learn what really works and what doesn’t. The world of nutrition and health is full of stories – we all have them – of diets, pills, treatment protocols, that worked for somebody, sometimes miraculously. Yet, anyone who has followed the excitement for more than a few years can remember many examples of supposedly settled science that just didn’t pan out. Each generation seems to find its own dietary enemy, the One Big Cause of our numerous epidemics. Cholesterol! Fat! Carbohydrates! Gluten! Salt! Sugar! Grains! You can find a peer-reviewed study that supports or refutes just about any health claim imaginable. What to do! Confronted with so many contradictory suggestions, most people simply give up. Pick a source of expertise you trust, and stick with it, often a government-run source, a major hospital or research institution, or perhaps one of the many online “health gurus” that claim to have the answer. I am surprised at how many people will suffer for decades an unwanted health condition – obesity, allergies, gut issues – all the while enduring a treatment that doesn’t work, just because it was recommended by an expert, never considering the possibility that the expert might be wrong. But as the emerging Quantified Self movement has shown, it is also possible to follow another source: your own self-experiments. Measure your weight daily and compare it to your activity level on your Fitbit. Use a glucose monitor to test how your body reacts to various types of food. Track the number of hours you sleep each night and see if it varies based on what you had for dinner. These are just a few typical experiments you’ll find highlighted at any Quantified Self meetup. Generally these experiments are cheap and easy, often amounting to little more than a notepad and some simple math. But some people go much further. As you’ll see, I’m one of those people. I became interested in the microbiome via a long-time fascination with biology and genetics. As a software engineer, I couldn’t help noticing the many analogies between the “hardware” part of being a human (our bodies) and the “software” (our brains and behavior). The entire instruction manual for how to build a human being is encoded in the DNA that we each hold in every cell of our bodies. If only we could decode that DNA, we would learn so much about health and well-being, and we might even be able to manipulate it. It was that hope that ended up being dashed the first time I tested myself using one of the consumer DNA testing kits that became available in the early 2000s. Yes, I learned a few genetic facts about myself: my eye color, my tolerance for lactose, my ancestry. But those were facts that my mother already knew about me. Worse, none of the additional information was actionable. I found that just about any serious condition described by these tests is disappointingly free of specifics, beyond the standard advice to “eat more fruits and vegetables”, which we should all do anyway. And even in cases where the science is well-understood – such as the link between smoking and cancer – the actual odds of your developing a disease are rarely 100%. Everything seems to come down to a frustrating set of (1) advice you should do anyway, and (2) information about probabilities. The microbiome, I found, is different. The genetic material encoded in your body’s microbes vastly outnumbers your human genes, and there is evidence that it has an effect on nearly every aspect of human existence, from diseases (and prevention of diseases) to how we digest food, and even to our behavior. What’s more, the microbiome changes daily, and we can affect how it changes. Even the advice I received after my DNA testing (“eat more vegetables”) may in fact work because it affects the microbiome. But then we’re back to the original problem: how do you know what’s true and not true about the microbiome, especially since microbiome science has a magical combination of features that makes it especially attractive to potential hypesters: The field is new, and interesting discoveries are announced nearly every day, so you won’t draw skepticism if you can credibly claim some new insight. Data abounds. Every person is covered in thousands of species (probably a lot more), and the types and varieties change hourly. No matter when or how you take a sample, you’ll find something new. There really is something there. We are surrounded by gazillions of microbes, many of which have co-evolved with humans and are well-adapted to our bodies. Intriguing relationships have been discovered between microbes and many – maybe most – human conditions, including a plethora of diseases as well as behavior, mood, and cognition – areas you don’t usually associate with infections. You can change it. Unlike your human genes, the microbiome shifts in response to food, medicine, environment, and many other variables that scientists are just beginning to understand. It really does seem likely that many of the seemingly far-out claims about the microbiome may hold up, eventually. While this makes me excited about the potential of the microbiome, I’m also wary of over-exaggerated claims, so when I first began to study the science for myself, I always asked the question: “How do you know?”. Sadly, I found that when I ask most experts about how they know something specific about the microbiome, the answer essentially amounts to “I read it somewhere”. Oh sure, the better experts will speak more eloquently, pointing to a peer-reviewed study, as if that settles it. More often that not, I found other peer-reviewed studies that said the exact opposite. Relying on “the literature” is a fancy way of saying “I read it somewhere”. This book is for those who want to know the truth for themselves. You may have a specific reason you want to understand more about the microbiome: perhaps you know somebody who suffers from a condition about which “experts” disagree. Or perhaps (like me) you are healthy but are simply curious and want to be as healthy as possible. You’ve read a number of books, but are frustrated at all the contradictory advice. That was my situation a few years ago when I first began to study the microbiome for myself, so I set myself the goal to learn for myself. Instead of trusting what I read somewhere from an “expert”, I asked to see the actual microbiome test results: demonstrate how you had low levels of the microbe before trying your experiment, and now you have high levels. You don’t have to do a fancy study. You don’t have to run a randomized control trial. Just show that it worked one time, on you. For the past three years, I’ve been doing exactly that. After hundreds of microbiome tests on myself, and even more that I’ve seen from others, I’ve compiled my own list of experiments, some of which work and some which don’t. In the course of doing these self-experiments, I developed a number of computer tools that helped me understand my microbiome. Those tools are available now for free and this book will show you how to use them. I think you’ll find that it’s quite easy to learn some basic things about the microbiome, and when you do, you’re much better off than if you simply say “I read it somewhere”. "],

Let’s look at some examples to get an idea of how ubiquitous and hardy they can be, and then we’ll back up with a short intro to the science of biology. Finally, we’ll discuss how scientists study the human microbiome. 1.1 Microbes everywhere Virtually all of the life around you is invisible. We tend to forget about things we can’t see, ignoring that which is literally under our noses, but it’s there: living, eating, reproducing lifeforms of incredible tenacity and surprisingly important effects on the world we can see. Life is tenacious, fighting for and keeping its niche in just about every environment it encounters. In the sky, deep underground, in the most barren habitats cold or hot anywhere on earth, there are lifeforms. The vast majority of these are microbes, so small we can’t see them, but small doesn’t mean irrelevant. In fact, the more that science understands about the invisible microbial world, the more it becomes clear that these uncountably numerous creatures exert a much bigger effect than we think. Every traditional culture recognizes a role for the invisible, often translated with words like “spirit” or “life force”, sometimes with more expressive terms like “angels”, “demons”, “gods” or even, simply, “God”. Sometimes the more serious people dismiss these invisible forces as so much superstition, as though truth is made only of things we can see, but of course that’s not quite true either. With the right instruments, we can see many invisible things; some of the greatest discoveries happen when a new gadget makes people aware of a world that was previously hidden. The invisible world of microbes is like that, with new, low-cost technologies showing us incredible, rich, living universes waiting to be explored. The word “microbe” refers to any tiny organism that carries its own genetic information for purposes of propagating itself. Far too small to see with the naked eye, dozens could fit inside a typical human cell. Although it’s common to think of microbes and bacteria as the same thing, in fact there are at least seven different types of microorganism: bacteria, extremophile life forms called archaea that live and thrive in environments too challenging for bacteria, protozoa, algae, fungi, viruses, and some multi-cellular animal parasites such as helminths. Each of these has its own characteristic body type, means of reproduction, and ways of moving around. Let’s look next at some of these environments and see the odd places where microbes have been found. 1.1.1 Microbes above and below Even the sky contains living microbes. Scientists at the Institut de Chimie de Clermont-Ferrand in France have for decades sampled clouds to determine their precise contents, and sure enough: they finds plenty of life there, usually between 1,000 and 10,000 bacterial cells per milliliter — not all that different from the amount you’d find in alpine snow. Like every living organism, these cells must soak up water and other nutrients, converting them into energy and various by-products, which collectively have a massive effect on the overall atmosphere, more than enough to affect climate.1 source: ASMScience The upper atmosphere is a harsh place for life: regular freezing and thawing, constant bombardment of UV radiation from the sun during the day, cold, subzero freezing temperatures at night, high speed, unpredictable winds that quickly disperse any colonies. Plus, at any moment these organisms can find themselves flushed to the ground in a rainstorm, where they’ll need to adapt again. These extreme conditions are just another day in the life for one species commonly found in clouds, Pseudomonas syringae, which harbors a protein in its cellular wall that reacts to cold temperatures, alternately preventing and allowing a water molecule to turn into ice and back. It doesn’t take many of these reactions to generate precipitation. With so many cells constantly floating in the atmosphere, even small changes in concentration — perhaps due to human activity on the ground — can, at least theoretically, make the difference between rainfall and drought. How much of an effect is hard to say: you can imagine how difficult it is to study bacteria floating in the sky. Our inability to access these environments is often the biggest reason we remain ignorant of the life that is found there, but there have been many attempts to learn more. Formal studies about the viability of microbes in space have been conducted since the early 1960s,2 when Apollo-era scientists wanted to understand the dangers of space travel, both to any humans in space as well as to those of us on the ground who might be exposed to any intersteller visitors. Although new and bizarre extremophiles are discovered regularly, so far it appears that even the hardiest of known organisms have a tough time when directly exposed to solar ultraviolet radiation. But the particularly resilient spore-making Bacillus subtilis, for example, it is estimated could survive for at least six years if it were shielded somehow from direct sunlight, say embedded inside a meteorite.3 Several lichen species, including rock colonizing Rhizocarpon geographicum and Xanthoria elegans, and the vagrant Aspicilia fruticulosa, remained alive after ten days of direct UV exposure on board a European Space Agency spacecraft.4 Some especially hardy cyanobacteria that came with the lichens didn’t survive, so perhaps space offers a better chance for multicellular life, which has the luxury of outer protective pigmented layers. Traces of plankton, for example, have been found in space, on the surface of the International Space Station, where they are believed to have floated from the upper atmosphere.5 Why?! How did they get there! Who knows! What is known is that between a quarter and two-thirds of microbes in the air are entirely new and undiscovered organisms. A study of the “air microbiome” above New York City found bacteria and viruses that apparently originated in water, soil, vegetation, as well as in animals and humans, but even then few patterns emerge. Although there appear to be distinct microbial environments, on the land versus water, for example, overall many of these organisms are quite hardy and seem to find themselves migrating all over the place. Scientists studying a water-filled fracture two miles underground at the Mponeng gold mine near Johannesburg, South Africa, discovered Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator by accident, after noticing odd levels of hydrogen compounds, by-products of the activity of an isolated bacterial colony.6 Interestingly, this organism is a member of the same Firmicutes phylum that dominates human guts, though this particular bacterium evolved quite separately from us: it hasn’t been exposed to surface water for millions of years. A systematic study of its genome revealed that, unlike other bacteria that usually live in co-dependent colonies, this one can survive all by itself, feeding on tiny bits of radioactive energy from uranium decay in an environment far removed from all other energy sources. It’s not a great life: these creatures reproduce rarely, only once every few hundred or thousand years. But at least they don’t have to worry about being consumed by predators down there. Subglacial Lake Whillans is a lake buried under more than 800 meters of ice in the West Antarctic. A careful underground bore hole inserted by a team from Louisiana State University in 2014 found more than 4,000 different species of bacteria surviving under that ice. The total bacterial count was not that different from what you’d find in surface lakes on other parts of the planet, a fact that is especially surprising for an environment that hasn’t had a ray of light in millions of years. The bacteria instead thrive on iron, sulphur, and nitrogen as energy sources.7 Those may not be the deepest examples. A Cold War-era Soviet team drilling the world’s deepest hole, were forced to abandon the project in 1994 at 12,261 meters (or 7.5 miles) underground, when they hit temperatures above 180 °C (or 356 °F), too hot for their equipment. Apparently the conditions weren’t too hot for life, though: the nine-inch diameter Kola Superdeep Borehole8 found 24 species of fossilized plankton among the two-billion-year-old rocks down there. Of course, fossils are not the same thing as living microbes, but even dead remnants at that depth is evidence of the tenacity of life. Still other microbes thrive in radioactive environments, like the dangerous interior of a nuclear reactor. Deinococcus radiodurans is an extremophile member of Phylum Deinococcus-Thermus that boasts an impressive built-in DNA repair mechanism that lets it survive cold, vacuum, acid, light, dehydration – you name it. It remains unbothered by radiation levels more than 1,000 times higher than would kill a human. 1.1.2 Microbes around you You don’t have to go to extreme conditions to find unusual microbes. Microbes thrive whereever humans live, and they are in our everyday environment too. The recent PathoMap study of DNA collected from the New York City subway found that, like the air above, half of the microbes we walk past everyday are unknown to science.9 Most of the organisms are apparently benign, with no obvious affect on humans one way or another. Even when known pathogens are found, including Yersinia pestis (Bubonic plague) and Bacillus anthracis (anthrax), the lack of reported infections indicates that probably these organisms are busying themselves for some other, unknown, and maybe even useful purpose. Generally the microbes seem content to exist patiently with no apparent affect on the environment. A station flooded by Hurricane Sandy showed a similarity to a marine environment a year after the disaster. Humans are the source of many unusual microbes in our environment. Regularly shedding 1.5 million skin cells per hour, leftover inhabitants of our bodies can colonize a hotel room in less than six hours.10 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3655107/ We found that infants living with pets had significant over-representation of Clostridiaceae,Veillonella (especially for dogs), Peptostreptococcaceae and Coprococcus. Bifidobacteria were under-represented among infants living with pets (especially for cats). For dogs only, there was also under-representation of Eggerthella 1.1.3 Microbes and food We like our food pure and clean, and so do microbes. Well, some microbes. Freshly-washed produce is a just a colonization opportunity for many species, for whom the lack of competition is a shot at a fresh start. Before washing, plants are covered in microbes, from the flowers and branches to the roots. Seeds planted in sterilized soil will germinate, but can’t grow regardless of the nutrients, water, or sunlight you give them. The relationship between soil bacteria and plants is a complicated and understudied one, but what is known is that every plant hosts its own unique species of microbe in a symbiotic relationship as tight as any on earth. The microbes tangled in the roots of a corn or wheat plant, for example, are highly specific to that particular strain. Swap out the microbes, or – worse – sterilize the soil, and the plant can’t take advantage of the nutrients sitting right at hand, because they are in a form that is useless until digested by microbes. After harvest and processing, our meals still contain a surprising variety of microbes. Of course, sometimes this is deliberate: some of us eat fermented foods like sauerkraut or yogurt to ingest the microbes that were grown to make their special flavor or texture. But even everyday foods, like raw vegetables, will naturally be covered with healthy levels of microbes. You will ingest somewhere between 1.4 million and 1.3 trillion microbes per day, depending on what type of diet you follow. Eat according to USDA guidelines and you’ll be at the high end of the range, emphasizing fruits and vegetables, lean meat, dairy, and whole grains; the lower end is more typical of a vegan diet, or even a typical American convenience food-style diet of “junk food”. Interestingly, you’ll get roughly the same diversity of microbes no matter which diet you follow, although there can be a difference depending on whether the food is raw or cooked.11 We eat plants for their nutrients, but what exactly counts as a “nutrient” is often in the eye of the beholder. Plants don’t like to be eaten any more than the rest of us, and they have developed powerful defense mechanisms to keep out predators, including microbes. In fact, it’s those anti-microbial properties that make many plants medicinally useful. One estimate showed that of 18,000 plants available to Native Americans, only 1,625 were used as food; but 2,564 were used as drugs, many of which are specifically there to manipulate microbes.12 Extrapolate that to the estimated 500,000 different plants on earth, only about 1-10% of which are useful as foods to humans, and it becomes clear that microbes play a big role in which plants thrive and which don’t. You’re not necessarily immune from accidental antibiotic ingestion if you simply avoid eating antibiotic-treated meat. Between 70% - 90% of the antibiotics given to farm animals are ultimately discharged in their manure, which if administered as fertilizer, can coat the soil used for growing food plants. Although antibiotics naturally degrade over time, the process can take months and under many conditions, giving ample time to be taken up in to plants that we eat, so even hard-core vegans may be getting more antibiotics than they like.13 1.1.4 Anti-microbials in food Even plants that depend on pollinators, or those that spread their seeds by being ingested by birds, don’t necessarily like to be eaten whole and completely. Leafy grasses attract ruminants like cows or sheep with large tasty fibrous leaves that the plant offers in order to bring in the high-nitrogen feces that will help the plants grow better. See one list of known plant-derived antimicrobials here. One powerful deterrent to insects is the chemical caffeine, produced in abundance by plants in the genus Coffea, including the species Coffea arabica, commonly known as coffee. A powerful toxin against insect invaders, caffeine in the seeds of this plant will kill nearly all invaders. In fact, few insects are known to have any tolerance to caffeine –ensuring that the plant can continue to reproduce unmolested by predators. But no matter how clever, these self-defense mechanisms aren’t foolproof. One beetle, the coffee berry borer is a notorious bane of Brazilian coffee growers for the way it munches on the coffee beans without any ill effects. When scientists studied this pest, they discovered something missing in the berry borer’s feces: caffeine.14 How could these bugs eat so much caffeine without becoming poisoned? The reason turned out to be Pseudomonas fulva, a tiny inhabitant of the beetle’s gut, and the only microbe with a gene called ndmA that can metabolize caffeine. Borer beetles without this microbe accumulate large amounts of unmetabolized caffeine and are unable to reproduce. 1.1.5 Fermented food In some foods, living microbes aren’t along just for the ride – they are the ride. Most raw foods will quickly spoil if left uneaten for too long. We say “spoiled”, but really we mean the food is consumed by bacterial species who leave by-products that are not edible or pleasant for humans. Under the right circumstances, though, food can Before refrigerators, the long-term preservation of food Yes, much of that yogurt makes it past the stomach and into the gut. 1.1.6 Fiber and your gut microbes Short-chain fatty aides (SCFA) created when gut bacteria break down fiber. Pulverising and juicing reduces fiber content. e.g. whole wheat grains have 12g, but fine-ground has only 3g. a 200ml bottle of orange juice has 1.5g fiber, but four oranges has 12. The best overview of microbes and food is Scott et al. (2013) 1.2 Microbes and health The great French scientist Louis Pasteur, working as a physician in the 1800s, was the first to popularize the idea that the world is covered in germs, invisible agents that he associated with food spoilage and disease. Simple steps at hygiene, he discovered, could make conditions inhospitable for them, enabling better food storage and dramatically fewer illnesses. Working as a chemistry professor in the 1850s, one of his students, the son of a local wine manufacturer, sought his help to solve problems with souring. Subsequent investigations led him to conclude that invisible yeasts were the culprit, and that exposure to air could affect the rate of fermentation. Pasteur’s emphasis on controlling these microbes led to a general association of germs as pathogens, a bad, even evil force that we must destroy, every single time. The only good germ is a dead germ. And for good reason. The development of effective disinfectants, and then antibiotics – germ killers –- was one of the greatest medical achievements of all time, saving the lives of a significant fraction of the human race. Before Pasteur, urban life was a precarious game of chance against diseases that seemed to come and go randomly. Thanks to the development of the Germ Theory of Disease, it was suddenly possible to imagine a world where deadly illnesses and infections could be controlled and perhaps eliminated. Now, every day of your life, modern amenities like running water and flush toilets keep you healthy simply by controlling the growth of microbes. Some can be quite nasty. The bacterium that causes Cholera, Vibrio cholerae, after infecting the small intestine, promptly hijacks the body’s natural defense systems into sending a large stream of water through the colon to flush out all other bacteria. Normally, this would be an appropriate response to an invasion, but by hiding above the colon, Vibrio cholerae continues to breed above the main flow of water. The resulting diarrhea is so fierce that the patient is literally unable to drink enough to make up for the outflow, and dies of dehydration within days. And in a final act of cruelty, that water that the body pushes out so fiercely is itself full of V. cholerae, who use the opportunity to infect others who come in contact with the water. Campylobacter jejuni: food poisoning from raw chicken The toxins produced by the Clostridium genus are among the most dangerous. Botulism (C. Botulinin) Tetanus (C. Tetani), gangrene (C. perfringens), and of course C. Dificile. Some bacteria simply use the darkness and wet warmth of the colon as a breeding ground, happily feasting on the materials they find there. They cause trouble not by what they eat, but by what they excrete: nasty toxins that mess up some other part of the body. Clostridium botulinum produces the neurotoxic protein botulinum that can weaken or freeze nerve cells. The most acutely lethal toxin known – only 2 billionths of a gram can kill – botulinum is almost as deadly to people as the plutonium in a nuclear bomb. Just a few pounds under the right conditions would kill everyone on earth. Part of what makes pathogens so dangerous is it takes so few of them to be deadly. Some Shigella species, for example, become infectious with a starter colony of as few as ten organisms.15 With such terrible killers lurking out there, it’s tempting to divide all microbes into “bad” (pathogenic), “good” (probiotic) and “neutral” (commensal). You’ll find plenty of lists that do just that. But often, perhaps usually, the distinction between good and bad is unclear. Consider the “viridans” Streptococci, a group name for a whole breed of related microbes commonly found harmlessly in human mouths. If a few of these escape the mouth and somehow enter the bloodstream, they can land on a heart valve and can cause a dangerous, life-threatening infection. But inside the mouth they are tough competitors to other bacteria that may want a foothold, like the Streptococcus that causes Strep Throat. Mix Viridans with Strep A, and Viridans wins every time. So is it good or bad? Well, it’s bad if your Viridans makes it to the heart; but in its regular form it protects you from other infections.16 Another example, Staphylococcus aureus, found in about a quarter of all Americans, is the agent behind a host of infections ranging from mild skin ailments to the deadly, often untreatable MRSA. But it seems to be harmless when in the presence of Corynebacterium species.17 Lactobacillus is especially good at crowding out pathogens. Does Proteobacteria play a role? TS: Only 52 of the 4200 compounds found in normal mice blood were identified in germ-free mice. The implication is that most of the chemicals in our blood are synthesized by microbes. Toxic food and fast food mice Feed junk food to germ-free mice and nothing happens Western diet induces dysbiosis with increased E coli in CEABAC10 mice, alters host barrier function favouring AIEC colonisation. Martinez-Medina M1 ) 1.2.1 Food Allergies If you attended elementary school before the 1980s, you can remember a time before nut allergies, when school lunches served peanut butter to everyone without the slightest worry that it might cause problems. Clostridia may counter sensitivity to peanuts18 1.2.2 Gluten It’s been well-established that a gluten free diet impacts the microbiome. This shouldn’t be too surprising, given that gluten is a nutrient for some bacteria but not others. But what about people who show an unusual sensitivity, even allergy, to gluten? What’s the cause? Recently the idea of a gluten free diet has taken on fad diet status. Despite surprisingly little research evidence that it can quantitatively affect health, millions of people swear that gluten gives them various ailments from poor digestion to brain fog. If you don’t believe it, they’ll say, try it yourself and see; and sure enough, many of those who go off gluten claim big health benefits. Eating is usually a zero-sum game: stop eating one thing (say, the gluten in wheat) and you’ll end up eating more of something else (rice or corn). Is it the switch to a different diet — and the anticipation of success that this brings — that makes people feel better, or is there something really significant about gluten itself? The experts say no, with one important exception. A tiny fraction of people do suffer from Celiac disease, a known disorder of the body’s ability to handle gluten. There are well-established tests that can definitely tell whether you have Celiac disease or not, and although the vast majority of people test negative, those who are true Celiacs will immediately and obviously benefit from a gluten free diet. But what’s driving the difference? As usual, the genetic evidence isn’t completely lock-tight. Although a third of the population have particular versions of the (DQ2 or DQ8) of a cellular receptor called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA), only a tiny minority go on to develop serious gluten sensitivities. Some studies indicate gluten sensitivity arises at an early age, and that perhaps celiac disease can be prevented by exposing babies to gluten at just the right moment, but other studies say the opposite.19 These are all clues that the microbiome may be involved, and sure enough, many studies show a definite difference between healthy microbiomes and those with clinically-proven Celiac disease.20 But because Celiac sufferers tend to eat differently than non-sufferers, it can be hard to tell how much of the microbiome is a result of a different diet, and how much is due to the disorder. Another clue happens further up the digestive system. Spanish researchers looking at the small intestine found curiously similar microbiomes in both healthy and celiac patients..21 The difference happened at the functional level of what those bacteria do, and not necessarily in just whether the microbe is present or absent. Lactobacillus, it turns out, is one of the best degraders of gluten22, but there are others: Bacillus pumilus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most interestingly, unlike Lactobacillus, some of these bacteria can do more than just digest the gluten: they appear to contain enzymes that transform the gluten — pointing to the possibility that the enzymes produced by these microbes could be purified and used to eliminate traces of gluten from food products. So if Celiac disease is caused by a change in the way some microbes function, how did that change happen in the first place? One theory is that it’s a virus. Researchers at the University of Chicago and University of Pittsburgh were able to supercharge the way mice react to gluten by infecting them with a reovirus that apparently changes something about the body’s immune response in the presence of the gluten protein.23 Where did this modern plague come from? The first case to appear in medical journal didn’t happen until 1969 (Golbert), and examples were extremely rare before that. In fact, the very first mention of a food allergy happened about 100 years ago (Schloss). Martin Blaser thinks something odd has happened because of the overuse of antibiotics. Amish microbes are very diverse google: “Zupancic microbiota Old Order Amish” PLOS 2012 partly because they drink lots of raw milk [requested paper Genetic Architecture of the immune system http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25772697 ] “We have probably seen the worst of the asthma epidemic which was at its height in the 80s and 90s” google: “Song cohabiting family members share microbiota with one another and with their dogs” 1.2.3 Other microbes and digestion Bacteroides plebeius : Japanese version can digest seaweed, thanks to genes stolen from Zobellia galactanivorans, that lives on the seaweed. Renouf J Nutr 2011 says it’s Bacteroides uniformis that breaks down the soy (and why Asians find soy healthier than americans) 1.3 Probiotics Probiotic supplements are a $34 billion business, of which at least $6 billion is supplements, according to a May 2016 report by BCC Research. With unregulated health claims that range from the benign (“helps digestion”) to the fantastic (“A miracle cure!”), do they make a significant difference in my own gut microbiome? Among unhealthy people, there is evidence that, under a doctor’s care, probiotics can help with antibiotic-associated diarrhea and similar conditions in children or among people recovering from C. difficile infections. On the other hand, a recent scientific review of all well-done studies of probiotics among healthy people couldn’t find evidence that probiotics made much difference compared to a placebo in randomized controlled trials. When the data-heavy web site FiveThirtyEight did a week-long series on Gut Science, including a detailed survey of what’s known about probiotics, they concluded: “There’s no evidence in humans, however, to support taking probiotics just to generally improve your gut health.” As a healthy adult of normal weight who eats an omnivore diet with plenty of fresh vegetables, I’m not going to answer whether probiotics are “good” for anything. A literature review by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found no safety issues in healthy adults, but the over-the-counter supplements you see sold at health food stores are not regulated by the FDA, and the uBiome test isn’t appropriate for medical purposes anyway. My only goal is to see whether the test shows a change in the specific organisms intended by the manufacturers. The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) defines probiotics as “live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host”. Experts reserve the term “probiotic” for supplements, as opposed to foods that happen to contain live, healthy microorganisms, but that distinction is lost on most people, who just want to be sure they consume enough “good” bacteria. Perhaps this is a good time to keep up my regular rant about why I don’t like the term “good” or “bad” when it comes to microbes. Everything depends on context: it’s possible to have too much of a good thing, just as it’s possible to have too little of some bad things. Nature knows how to manage a delicate balance and it’s foolhardy to pretend we know all the consequences of a major change in either direction. Martin Blaser, in his excellent book Missing Microbes, reminds us of the native proverb: Elk are there to feed the wolves; wolves are there to keep the elk strong.&quot; You may not want to get rid of everything, nor would you want to fill yourself up with too much of anything. I’m especially interested in learning whether the probiotics in the supplements actually “stick” in my gut. Taking so many billion organisms in pill form all at once may very well show up in a single gut test result, but how do I know they’re not simply being flushed out of my system? Or worse, how do I know I’m not just crowding out something more important? Like anything you put into your body, you can’t just assume it’s all upside. Presumably you’re reading this because you are convinced that microbes have a powerful affect on the body, perhaps as powerful as prescription drugs, yet you wouldn’t consider taking random prescription drugs just to see what happens. The billions of microbes you send into your gut is in a concentration and quantity far greater than anything you’d get from nature. Please remember that. Here’s an analogy: let’s say scientists discover a breed of parrot that is found in abundance in healthy ecosystems in Costa Rica, so they decide to introduce it to Yellowstone Park. They dump thousands of live parrots all over the park and when they count the overall species diversity the following day, they note with pride that the experiment worked: Yellowstone is now home to a new species, one that is associated with healthy ecosystems! Unfortunately, upon testing again a week later, they learn that the parrots are gone. What happened? You and I can laugh at the idiots who thought they could transplant a tropical species into Wyoming, but maybe that’s exactly what you’re doing if you try to introduce a new species that is not adapted to your microbiome. It may show up in a couple of early gut tests, but if it disappears soon thereafter, was it helpful at all? In the parrot example, it may actually be harmful if it served as food to dangerous predators. Fortunately, the body is pretty robust and, for better or for worse, it’s hard to deliberately change the microbiome. 1.3.1 Where to read more http://isappscience.org/consumers/ lengthy list of other resources http://usprobioticguide.com/ Clinical Guide to Probiotic Products Expert Consensus Document published by the peer-reviewed scientific journal Nature (2014) 1.4 Other topics 1.4.0.1 Fasting 1.4.0.2 Antibiotics 1.4.0.3 Hygiene 1.5 Microbes and behavior Bacteroides Fragilis is depleted in autistic patients. it is a gatekeeper for the immune system [ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16009137] Sutterella may have implications for autism, causes tics ?

Mark Lyte and his colleagues, a microbiology team from the Minneapolis Medical Research Foundation, studied the effect of infecting mice with campylobacter, one of the bacteria implicated in the Walkerton epidemic. The dose of bacteria was high enough to be detected in the intestine, but not so high that the mice developed overt illness. You probably won’t be surprised to learn that the campylobacter-infected mice exhibited more anxiety when navigating a maze than the control mice. Lactobacillus rhamnosus: (NYTimes): (John Cryan, neuroscientist) “mice stressed during pregnancy pass on lowered levels of the bacterium to their pups. This type of bacteria is known to release immense quantities of GABA; as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA calms nervous activity, which explains why the most common anti-anxiety drugs, like Valium and Xanax, work by targeting GABA receptors.” http://www.microbiomeinstitute.org/blog/2016/1/7/gut-dysbiosis-in-anorexia-nervosa-patients Scientists in Japan characterized the microbiome of AN patients and compared them to healthy controls. They studied 25 women with Anorexia Nervosa and compared their microbiomes to 21 age-matched healthy females. They found that AN patients had a lower amount of total bacteria and specifically, lower amounts of C. coccoides group, C. leptum subgroup, B. fragilis, andStreptococcus. 1.6 Biology basics With all this complexity, how do you begin to study the abundance of life around us? And then, how do we apply what we know about the zillions of organisms around us, to how they relate to what’s inside us? The methodically classification and analysis of life is the science of biology, and like life itself it is a very broad field. Fortunately, despite the incredible variations, scientists have discovered a few simple traits and rules that apply to every life form. For the special life form homo sapiens, we have also learned a number of simplifications that will let us talk in more detail later. 1.6.1 The Basics The study of biology starts with the cell, those tiny self-contained blocks that are the very definition of life. From the most humble microbe to the biggest animal, every living thing is made of these structures, which are really just miniature chemical reactors that pull external molecules from their environment and reassemble them in ways that perpetuate the reaction. Everything in the universe tends over time to fall into disorganized entropy, but cells contain many tricks, honed over billions of years of evolution, to thrive. Despite the diversity of life, a surprising number of those tricks are shared by all cells: a wall to protect and allow exchanges with the outside world, a means of storing information through DNA, and of course a process of reproduction. The biggest technical difference among cells is not size or even function, but rather the distinction between two broad categories: eukaryotes, which are the cells of everything from corn plants to humans to fungi and amoebas, and prokaryotes, which are always single-celled bacteria and other microbes. It’s interesting enough that all life could be characterized into these distinct groups, but if you look at the DNA that defines each cell, you will find some other odd differences that hint at more refined relationships among living things. A cell’s DNA contains all the information needed to create another copy of itself; even the instructions for how to do the copying are just a sequence of predictable DNA letters written somewhere in the genetic code of all cells. This very important copying function is performed by a ribosome, which is a complicated but well-studied part of every living thing. Because the ribosome has such a fundamental function, it tends not to fall prey to many mutations over time; after all, a single DNA letter change in the ribosome is almost always fatal to the entire cell. But every so often — maybe every few million years — there is a mutation in some part of the ribosome, and this leads us to a clever way to understand better how living things are related to one another. Humans and monkeys, for example, may differ in many different parts of their DNA, but their ribosomes are nearly identical. In fact, the ribosomes of all mammals and even all vertebrates are virtually the same. Well, there are some differences, but interestingly the differences between large, obvious groupings like vertebrates or invertebrates are much more significant than the differences between different vertebrates, or between mammals or other creatures. In fact we can even quantify the differences, and scientists over the years have done exactly that. The ribosomes of humans and monkeys, for example, are different in only 10 places — practically nothing in a molecule that consists of a few thousand nucleotides connecting dozens of proteins. Similarly, the ribosomes of vertebrates and invertebrates are different in perhaps 100 places – clearly much more significant than the differences within each grouping, but still not terribly different relative to the entire ribosome. The ribosomes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, on the other hand, can be quite different: perhaps 1000 places (to continue this very-rough-but-sort-of-useful metric). The point is that even at the molecular, ribosome level, we can see obvious genetic differences even if the physical differences between two organisms aren’t necessarily obvious at first glance. A one-celled eurkaryote, like an amoeba or algae, for example, might seem like it should share something in common with a one-celled prokaryote, but looks are entirely deceiving: nobody looking just at the ribosome could possible mistake these as similar. Now, scientists have mapped the differences in ribosomal structure among nearly all living things and this general rule always applies: the groupings of life forms are directly related to the similarities or differences in their ribosomes. Meanwhile, scientists have made estimates of how long it takes, given various assumptions, for a series of step-by-step mutations to result in a differently-sized ribosome. In other words, using some basic chemistry that is easily demonstrated experimentally in a lab, we can offer some reasonable guesses for the number of generations it would take for a given level of random mutations to result in the differently-sized ribosomes we see in nature. Add it all up, and behold: you can see a reasonable fit with the clues we have in the fossil record and the geological record for the same creatures. None of this is perfect, of course, but the point is that we have a crude way to quantify how different one organism is from another and, if you like, we can guess how long it would take for a single common ancestor to accumulate enough random mutations to account for the differences between any two life forms. So far so good. Next let’s imagine we have a circle, where a single cell begins in the middle, divides into two cells, and those cells divide, etc. for zillions of years until there are clear ribosomal differences between each line. Let’s call this a family tree and take all known life forms and spread them into this circle. If you do that, you’ll find that the number of mutations necessary to generate all the variation found in eukaryotes – everything from corn plants to people – would take up only a tiny sliver of that circle. The rest of life — in particular the microbial life of prokaryotes – is so unimaginably diverse, that a space alien looking at earth’s lifeforms could well conclude that the differences between humans and corn plants aren’t significant enough to worry about. That’s how complicated the world of bacteria can be. 1.6.2 Taxonomy How do you talk about the relationships between various different life forms? A taxon is a simple unit of life. A homo sapiens is a taxon, but so is a primate. A mammal is a taxon too. It might seem odd in the ordinary biological world to bother using the same term ‘taxon’ to refer to all of those units, but for bacteria and anything that reproduces asexually, it’s an important distinction because often, taxonomists don’t agree about whether a group of organisms is part of the same taxon or not. Since Carl Linnaeus in the 1700’s, the science of taxonomy divides all life into seven major categories: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species (which I was taught in sixth grade to remember by the mnemonic “King Philip Came Over for Girl Scouts”). Bacteria make up their own kingdom. Just as the animal kingdom includes everything from humans to jellyfish to beetles, the diversity of bacterial life is enormous, a point which can’t be emphasized too much. This is true at every rank in the taxonomy. Even two organisms that are the same at a lower rank, like genus, might have radically different affects on the human body, just as a member of the animal genus Canis could be anything from a wolf or coyote to a Chihuahua. You cannot mix and match these ranks. If you know something about the number of organisms in one genus, for example, this is meaningful only in comparison to the numbers of another genus. Keep that in mind during our analysis. Sometimes there are different results, as noted by (Olesen and Alm 2016). 1.6.3 Microbiology All life runs on three chemical building blocks: DNA, RNA, and proteins. Each of these is an arbitrarily-long chain of repeating molecules called nucleotides (DNA or RNA) and amino acids (proteins). Due to constraints on the way atoms interact, the set of building blocks is fixed. All DNA is composed of only four nucleotides: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, represented by the letters ATGC. RNA is composed of the same molecules, except that uracile (U) is substituted for thymine. Similarly, proteins are constructed with only 20 different amino acids, which can again be represented by a short three-character abbreviation. The correspondence between these different proteins and combinations of DNA or RNA is referred to as the genetic code. As a programmer looking through all of this, you may immediately be inspired to write your own software version of this. After all, the remarkable consistency between all of these building blocks cries out for manipulation by computer. In fact, that’s exactly what bioinformaticians do, and numerous software packages have been developed to make it easy to treat these building blocks of life like ordinary computer strings. Perhaps the biggest challenge is the volume of data to be handled, which can easily be measured in gigabytes for a simple organism, but can require entire server farms in the case of some real-world biological systems. For that reason, much of bioinformatics is about optimizations to improve the speed of processing a large data set, or to simply the presentation in a way that can reveal the most biologically interesting aspects of a problem without wading in over-complexity. One special protein, DNA, can store information. 1.6.4 Human Anatomy Finally, to round out our overview of how biologists study the microbiome, let’s get specific about aspects of our own human bodies, and break it down into components, each of which as we’ll see play hosts to unique microbial communities. 1.6.4.1 Mouth 1.6.4.2 Stomach 1.6.4.3 Appendix Somewhere near the border between the small intestine and the large intestine (colon), there is a small, pinkie-like appendage bulging inconspicuously into the abdominal cavity. For most of the period of modern western medicine, nobody knew its function, other as a source of severe pain when it occasionally exploded in infections that until the development of antibiotics were usually fatal. Appendicitis used to be very rare (3-4 cases/year till 1890, up to 113 by 1918), which was fortunate, because there was no treatment. It was a sad fact that, for example the only death among the hundred or so frontiersmen and explorers on the Lewis and Clark expedition in the early 1800s was caused by appendicitis — a terrible, painful death in the wilderness but one that would have been just as inevitable at the finest hospitals in the world at the time. What’s known is that the appendix apparently houses three things: tissue from the immune system, a bunch of what are called IgA antibodies that fight infections, and tons of bacteria. What’s also known is that people who have their appendix removed surgically — usually as a result of one of those terrible infections — recover to live apparently normal lives, with no side effects even decades upon decades later. So what is the appendix doing? One clue comes from a recent study of 254 patients recovering from a C. Difficil infection, a horridly tenacious bacterium that has gained near-complete resistance to antibiotics and is notoriously difficult to treat. In the study, those with an appendix saw their infections come back 11% of the time, but those with no appendix suffered re-infection rates of 44% — a large and significant difference that has caused most scientists to speculate that the appendix is harboring something that enables the body to recover after a microbial disaster. My own interest in this subject is not idle curiosity. About fifty years ago, doctors at a small town hospital gave an appendectomy to my five-year-old self in order to treat an unusual belly ache. While doing what was apparently an exploratory surgery to find the cause, they came upon my otherwise healthy-looking appendix and decided on the spot to simply remove it. “Why not?” I’m sure they thought at the time. “If nothing else, it’ll prevent him from appendicitis”, which is as tautologically sound a reason as any. Did that change me, somehow? Am I fundamentally different because for most of my life I’ve been missing an important microbe safety zone that the rest of you enjoy? Science doesn’t know the answers, and even when there are studies based on well-conducted experiments, I can’t know the answer unless I do the experiment on me. [Hint: that’s exactly what I did: see Chapter 3] 1.6.4.4 Small Intestine 1.6.4.5 Colon 1.7 The technology for studying microbes People have been farming the microbes in fermented foods for thousands of years, so when in Pasteur times, scientists first began to cultivate them for experiments, the most obvious way was through the process known as “culturing”. Take a sample containing some microbes of interest, and leave them sit in a hospitable environment long enough for them to reproduce in enough quantity to be useful. That’s still a common way to study microbes, and that couple-of-day incubation period is one reason you don’t get your lab tests back for a few days. But the techniques for uncovering which organisms are where and what they are doing was revolutionized in the first decade of the 2000s by those new-fangled gene sequencers that were so usefully applied to human genes. 1.7.1 The 16S Gene Despite the plunging costs of DNA sequencing, the trillions of microbes in your gut still represent a formidable chellenge if you intend to sequence them all. Even the humble E. coli bacteria contains nearly five million DNA letters. But fortunately, scientists in the past few years have discovered clever tricks to greatly simplify the problem, reducing the amount of sequencing required to a level that can be reasonable done in a few hours for a fraction of the cost of running through all the DNA found in the gut. Despite the variety of bacterial life in the world, the microbes in our bodies contain some important similarities to one another make it possible to identify unique organisms with just a small peek at a tiny part of their genomes. All bacterial cells come with a special protein-creation engine, the ribosome, that is so important to life that its essential functions are preserved across every organism known. Because all cells create proteins, they also always contain a ribosome and, importantly, they contain the instructions for how to create a ribosome. These instructions are encoded as a string of DNA, the length and weight of which is pretty constant across all bacteria. Presented with a glob of DNA, a careful lab technician can pull out just the ribosomal DNA by spinning the sample quickly in a centrifuge and waiting to see what collects at the line marked “16S”. The rest of the DNA, millions of letters (base pairs) per bactertia, is simply discarded. Ribosomal DNA for bacteria consists of about 1500 base pairs total, a tiny fraction of the entire genome, and although it is mostly identical across all bacteria, there are some differences, all of which are contained in nine “hypervariable” regions containing even fewer base pairs. These regions, named V1 through V9, are surrounded by strings of base pairs that are constant throughout all bacteria, and can be quickly discovered and amplified by the right DNA primers. The fourth one of these regions, V4, contains only 250 base pairs, and is quickly and easily sequenced on commercially-available sequencing machines. Once this section of DNA has been sequenced, lab scientists rely on one more trick, a reference database, to uncover the identity of the specific bacteria behind it. Although 250 base pairs may seem like a tiny number to differentiate among all possible bacteria on earth, for gut microbiome purpoes we need concern ourselves only with those that are known to inhabit humans. The Human Microbiome Project already identified most of these bacteria – and their 16S gene identifiers – so armed with that reference database, it is generally possible to unmask a specific microbe with just a sliver of DNA. 1.7.2 Limitations of 16S Unfortunately, despite its low cost and wide use, microbiome studies that focus only on the 16S gene suffer from several inaccuracies compared to other, more expensive methods. Microbes who share identical 16s sequences can occupy entirely different ecological niches: see: Jaspers and Overmann (2004) Now, thanks to new machines originally developed for mass DNA sequencing, the process of finding and understanding microbes has been revolutionized. It’s now possible to search for new life forms without growing them in a culture, and this has made possible a major shift in how to think about life —and what is important and special about human hardware. Unlike the genetic discoveries you can make by understanding your DNA (from a low-cost consumer service like 23andme), much of the news from the microbial world is actionable. There’s little, if anything, you can do if you find you have a particular type of gene that gives you, say, a propensity to alzheimers for example. But because the microbes around you are constantly changing anyway, and because you can influence which ones grow and which don’t, the world of the human micro biome is eminently actionable.

For less than $100, you send them a sample and a few weeks later they give you access to a private web page that will show you a breakdown of the types of bacteria they found. 2.2 Getting Started You just received an email that uBiome has finished processing your sample. Now what do you do? The first stop is the uBiome Explorer web dashboard, where you’ll see an overview of your results. The instructions there are self-explanatory and you’ll learn most of what you need to know by simply clicking around. The following explanation will help you dig deeper. If you only have one sample, your page will look something like this: Figure 2.1: uBiome Explorer Insights Overview That’s the Insights pane, designed to tell you the highlights. If this is your first time here, go ahead and breeze through this page, but don’t get caught up on details. As we’ll learn, scientists have barely scratched the surface of what we will eventually understand about the microbiome, so think of this page as a teaser – a hint of the potential. If your results show something you didn’t expect, say on diversity or body weight, don’t worry: it almost certainly just means that the Insights pane is wrong about you. Later we’ll see how to pull out far more interesting and useful results. Click next on the “My Bacteria” tab. The colorful pie chart there is your first high-level glimpse of the bacteria found in your sample. Hover over it with your mouse (or tap with your finger if you’re on a phone or iPad), to see a pop-up view of the approximate percentages. You’re seeing a phyla-based look at your microbiome. As we’ll learn in more detail later, this is a very high level view, a bit like how a Martian might see life on earth from far in outer space. Keep in mind that by “very high level”, we mean very high, the equivalent of seeing life only at the level of “vertebrate” and “invertebrate”. The incomprehensible diversity of bacterial life means that at this level, you don’t even bother separating fish from one another or for that matter, from land animals: just lump all of them together. At the phyla level, mammals, reptiles, fish – they’re all the same. Similarly, when you see the phylum Firmicutes, for example, think of it as having as encompassing as much variation as all the vertebrates, from those on land, in the ocean, big, small, harmless, dangerous and everything in between. In other words, this first approximation is pretty crude. This time the various phyla are represented as percentages of the whole, so some of them are relegated to tiny slices of the pie. That doesn’t necessarily mean they’re unimportant, though, because in the world of life, even some tiny populations can exert an outsized influence. A wolf is just one of a gazillion different creatures in Yellowstone National Park, but that is little comfort to a rabbit. Remember too that so far we’re treating each individual organism as if it’s the same size as the others, but that’s an oversimplification too, just like it would be a mistake to assume that elephants matter more because they’re bigger than humans. All we know at the phylum level is that proportionately, certain large classes of bacteria are more well-represented than others. That may not sound like much to go on, but as we’ll see, scientists have been able to learn quite a bit from tiny clues like this. 2.2.1 The most common phyla Most westerners will find their sample dominated by two phyla: Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. These are so common in healthy people that it’s tempting to assume this is “natural” or “normal”, but like much else with the microbiome, the situation is different outside the western world, a clue that it’s difficult to summarize a single individual’s microbiome as “good” or “bad.” It all depends. Firmicutes is usually the most common, and for good reason: it’s very good at sucking energy out of the types of high-fat, highly-processed food we eat in industrialized societies. For that reason, some scientists have claimed it might associate with obesity, since its presence might indicate a gut that is highly-optimized to pull as many calories as possible from food. On the other hand, it’s not hard to find skinny people with lots of Firmicutes, so this theory doesn’t always hold. I’ve seen it lower in vegetarians, and I suspect that maybe it reflects diet more than weight. In my own gut, while Firmicutes generally seems to be dominant, I find too much day-to-day variability to rely much on a single test. Here’s how my levels of the two most common phyla change on a daily basis: We’ll see much more detail later in the chapter on experiments. If you sampled on a Monday, you could well get a different answer than if you sampled on a Tuesday. Bacteroidetes is not as good at digesting fat, so it sticks to high-fiber foods like those in vegetables, which is why vegetarians tend to have high levels of this phylum. It’s often most prominent outside the industrialized world, too, where people eat less meat. Prevotella is associated with carbohydrates. Proteobacteria If you’re an otherwise normal omnivore and see double-digit amounts of this it can be a sign that your body was recently under attack. That’s because the Proteobacteria includes many pathogens like E. Coli and Shigella. For example, in one of my tests I had 14% Proteobacteria, which often is elevated in people with gastric disorders like Crohn’s disease. That doesn’t mean that Proteobacteria is bad; in fact, it could mean the opposite, that we need more of these to fight back invaders. In my case the unusually high amount came right after a long trip to Central America, during which my body was exposed to many new and possibly pathogenic microbes. My Proteobacteria fell soon after I returned to the U.S. and my normal diet. Proteobacteria: come back quickly after antibiotics (“a weed”) QuantifiedBody 2.2.2 How are you different? Since so little about the microbiome is well-understood, most of the time it will be hard to interpret your results by themselves. This is where the power of uBiome’s citizen science can help, because the web page lets you easily compare your results with other people. That first bacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus is an extremophile, usually only found in harsh environments, like the impossibly acidic human stomach. Why would I have so many more than other people like me? One clue is the similarly-high levels of Proteobacteria, which as we just noted is often high in people with gastro-intestinal issues. Maybe I was exposed to something that released a bit of stomach acid, and its extremophile Deinococcus into my colon. Verrucomicrobia is elevated too, though not by much. This is a Phylum that is generally associated with soil microbes, though it’s not unusual to find it in the gut as well. I looked back at my notes during the period of a few days before this sample, and interestingly I had been doing work in my garden at the time. We have deer and other animals that come near our house…is it possible that I was exposed to some animal excrement, maybe some of which somehow made it into my gut? It’s just a theory, and perhaps an unlikely one, but I wonder if my body was fighting some type of pathogen as a result of my outdoor activities. Now before we get too excited, keep in mind that I never felt the slightest bit ill during this period. Can I thank my microbiome? Perhaps I was exposed to something nasty, the kind of bug that under other circumstances might have wreaked havoc and left me terribly sick for days. Now I have no way of knowing for sure, but this tidbit makes me wonder if maybe my microbiome acted as a guardian angel, protecting me from something much worse. Similarly, your own results comparing to others may lead you to clues about aspects of your environment you didn’t otherwise suspect. Incidentally, since this test I’ve sent dozens of additional samples to uBiome and never saw that Deinococcus thing again. Good riddance? or maybe I should be thankful for the protection, and hope that little bits of it may still be present, undetectably in my stomach, waiting to fight another external enemy the next time I come in contact with something in the soil. 2.3 How to Use the uBiome Taxonomy Files The information you see in the uBiome web app is a greatly simplified view of the data torrent that comes from the gene sequencing machines that crunched your sample. Your raw data can be thousands of lines long, so to be more useful, uBiome provides a much more concise version. It’s called a “taxonomy” file, which is generally only a few hundred lines showing just the organisms that the uBiome computer algorithms think they found in your sample. Because uBiome JSON files are well-structured, it’s easy to process them with other software, including Excel. That’s our next step: bring this data into Excel. 2.3.1 Study your results in Excel The uBiome web interface includes an easy way to download your data as a CSV (comma-separated value) file, which can be read into a spreadsheet like Excel. Just click the ‘downloads’ in the ‘Advanced’ tab, like this: Then select “Download Taxonomy CSV” and a CSV copy of your results will be downloaded to your computer. Once the data is in Excel, you can work with it just as you would with any Excel data sheet. Here’s how one of my recent uBiome taxonomy files looks in Mac Excel: At this point, we can now apply the full power of your Excel skills to do the analysis. I usually start by turning the sheet into a “table”, to make it easier to do filtering and sorting later. Most popular spreadsheets have an easy way to do this. On Mac Excel, I do that from the “insert” menu: Once I have a table, then it’s easy to apply a filter. For now I just want to look at the Phylum level, so I click the tiny triangle to the right of the “tax_rank” label, like this: And now I can look just at the Phylum rank. I won’t bother showing each step after this, but after filtering and sorting, I can quickly end up with something like this: Looks like there is about 80% Firmicutes in this sample, with Bacteroidetes at about 12%, and a few other phyla under about 4%. We’ll go into more detail about what this means, but first let’s talk a little about the uBiome taxonomy file format. 2.3.2 uBiome JSON taxonomy files Excel is great for a quick overview of your sample, but to really take advantage of the raw data it helps to understand the raw JSON format. After uBiome’s lab completes the sequencing of your sample, the data generated goes into a bioinformatics pipeline where powerful algorithms use the zillions of DNA letters to find names for the specific organisms that inhabit you. One result, after many hours of computation, is a list of the organisms (taxa) found, along with their taxonomical rank and abundance. The result is stored in a simple structured text format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), commonly used across the web. Although it’s not as convenient for people as the rest of the uBiome web site, programmers refer to JSON as “human readable”, because if you squint enough you can sorta tell what it means without a computer program. Here’s a sample: { &quot;ubiome_bacteriacounts&quot;: [{ &quot;taxon&quot;: &quot;2&quot;, &quot;parent&quot;: &quot;131567&quot;, &quot;count&quot;: &quot;22691&quot;, &quot;count_norm&quot;: &quot;1000000&quot;, &quot;avg&quot;: null, &quot;tax_name&quot;: &quot;Bacteria&quot;, &quot;tax_rank&quot;: &quot;superkingdom&quot;, &quot;tax_color&quot;: null }, { &quot;taxon&quot;: &quot;1239&quot;, &quot;parent&quot;: &quot;2&quot;, &quot;count&quot;: &quot;15414&quot;, &quot;count_norm&quot;: &quot;679300&quot;, &quot;avg&quot;: null, &quot;tax_name&quot;: &quot;Firmicutes&quot;, &quot;tax_rank&quot;: &quot;phylum&quot;, &quot;tax_color&quot;: &quot;5E6591&quot; } JSON is just structured data. That’s it: a big bunch of lookup keys and values. The keys are unique identifiers and the values are their values. The whole file looks that way. The only requirement of a JSON file is that it be precisely consistent with this pattern, because after all it will need to be read by a computer eventually. The uBiome Taxonomy JSON files include the key uBiome_bacteriacounts which is mapped to a bunch of fields, each representing a particular organism found in your sample. Look at the figure above to get the basic idea. 2.3.3 The uBiome data tags Let’s review the meaning of each of the columns, which are derived from the following uBiome JSON keys: count: an absolute measure of number of organisms found in the sample. Without knowing the size of the sample, or how many times the DNA inside was processed through PCR amplification, this number doesn’t mean much except in relation to other counts at the same taxonomical rank. count_norm: a “normalized” version of the count, created by simply dividing the count on a given row by the count found on the row with tax_name = Bacteria and then multiplying by one million. It’s easier to just think of it as parts per million: each unit is 1 / 10,000th of a percent. For example, if you see a row with count_norm = 500,000, you can just think of that as 50% of the sample. tax_name: this is the classification of the organism based on the level of its taxonomy. If you were looking at a human being, for example, you would see homo sapiens if you selected tax_rank = species, but you’d see mammalia if you selected tax_rank = class. tax_rank: tells the level of the taxonomy. In daily conversation about animals or plants, we usually refer to the species (e.g. homo sapiens), but sometimes it’s more useful to talk about bigger groupings of related organisms. For example, humans are members of the class mammalia, along with tigers and horses. If this spreadsheet were counting organisms at the level of class mammalia, the count_norm would almost certainly be bigger than the count_norm for humans alone, unless humans were the only type of mammal found in the sample. taxon and parent: these help identify the ranking in a more precise way by pointing out which tax_ranks are subsets of which. For example, Bacteroidia above has a parent = 976, meaning that it is a subset of the taxon 976, Bacteroidetes. When you follow the various taxons and parents up the chain, you’ll see they all end in the superkingdom Bacteria, which has a taxon of 2. The values for these numbers, incidentally, are taxonomical numbers from the curated database at NCBI, the national bioinformatics center run by the U.S. government. Enter the number into the taxonomy browser at the NCBI Taxonomy Browser and you can learn as much as you want about that organism. tax_color doesn’t matter for this anaysis, but uBiome software uses this to colorize their pretty graphs to make them more readable. Of these fields, the most important ones are tax_name, tax_rank, and count_norm. 2.3.4 Converting uBiome taxonomy JSON to Excel As already noted, it’s easy to bring uBiome taxonomy data into Excel, and that’s fine for just one or two samples. But if you want more powerful analysis, you’ll need the raw JSON. Go to the uBiome Explorer page and click on the section labeled “Advanced” and then “Downloads”: You’ll see a page of JSON representing what uBiome found in your sample. On a desktop computer, if you select-all (press control-A or command-A) then you can copy this data to the clipboard and then into an email to share with a friend. If you like, you can even convert the JSON directly into Excel. Google “Json to Excel” or “Json to CSV” and you’ll find one. Just paste your data into one of those sites to convert it for either Excel’s native XLS or XLSX format, or the more universal CSV format, readable by Excel. Here are a few of the sites I’ve tested: http://www.convertcsv.com/json-to-csv.htm http://www.json-xls.com/json2xls It’s nice to know that we can always go back to a spreadsheet version when needed. But the real power of JSON comes when you want to handle more than just one or two samples. 2.4 Comparing samples There are two main things you’ll want to measure when comparing two samples: Uniqueness: which organisms are found in only one sample and not the other? If you are comparing two samples from the same individual (e.g. Yourself), then uniqueness is another way of talking about either extinctions (when a taxon has disappeared entirely in a later sample) and appearances (when a new taxon magically shows up). In other words, you care a lot about the order in which the samples were taken. On the other hand, if you’re comparing two separate individuals, then the ordering of the samples doesn’t matter. Uniqueness just tells which organisms are unique to a specific person. Relative abundance: which sample has more of which organism? There are two senses in which we care about the relative frequency of an organism’s occurrence in a sample. You might care, among all the taxons found, which ones are more highly represented in absolute amounts? Or you might care on a relative basis. To help understand why this matters, it may help to think of the following specific example: In many Americans the phylum Firmicutes makes up a majority of the sample, often reaching 60% or more. You might find two people, one who has 60% Firmicutes and the other with 30% — only half as much. The relative difference is 2x and the absolute difference is 30 percentage points. On the other hand, you might find Bifidobacterium makes up 10% of the first sample and 5% of the second. In this case, the relative difference is 2x — just like the Firmicutes case — but the absolute difference is only 5 percentage points, much less than in the first example. The built-in uBiome web tools look for relative differences. A taxon might be a minuscule component of both samples, but when you start from a small base, even a few additional organisms can make up a big percentage change. In the extreme case, a sample with a count_norm of 100 compared to another sample with a count_norm of 300 will show a 3X increase — very high in aBiome terms, even though the absolute difference is only 300 - 100 = 200 organisms. Compare that with a an organism with a count_norm of 50,000 in one sample and 51,000 in another sample. UBiome’s algorithms will treat these as a virtual tie, even though the absolute number of organisms in the second sample outnumber the first by 1,000 organisms. Which method of measuring is better? It depends on what you care more about. Some species need only a tiny representation in a sample to make a big difference in health outcomes. I prefer to use both methods of measurement: absolute number changes for the most popular taxons, and relative amounts more for the less-popular ones. 2.5 Make a single sheet with all your samples I often read news about a fresh scientific discovery involving the microbiome and immediately wonder if the discovery applies to me. For example, I recently saw a study from Oregon State University25 that seemed to find a link between high sugar diets and “cognitive flexibility”, i.e. your ability to adapt and adjust to changing circumstances. The study’s author, Kathy Magnusson, a professor in the OSU College of Veterinary Medicine, found that mice who eat lots of sugar have elevated levels of Clostridiales bacteria, and that this seemed to relate to a slower ability to solve a maze. Hmmm, I thought — how much Clostridiales do I have? If you have just one uBiome result, that’s easy: log into http://explorer.ubiome.com and search for it in the section “All My Bacteria”. But in my experience a single result doesn’t tell you much. You really need at least two and hopefully several uBiome results to see what might be actionable. In my case, I want to know how my Clostridiales may have changed over time. If you are comfortable with programming, uBiome has an opensource Python script to generate a single Excel table that combines multiple separate JSON files. Something like this: The data makes it easy to generate a chart showing how my Clostridiales changes over time: Hmmm, in my case it looks like something happened since last fall to increase my Clostridiales levels. Maybe it was the potato starch I tried in order to hack my sleep? Was it my trip to Central America in February? And of course the biggest question: has the increase affected my cognitive flexibility? I’m not really sure. Whatever happened, the level of Clostridiales seems to have stabilized in the past couple of months. uBiome has identified more than 900 unique taxa (groups of organisms) in the half-dozen samples I’ve submitted over the past year, and after running this script I have them all laid out on a single page. Now, armed with this one spreadsheet I can search anytime for a new microbe and quickly see if I have it now, or if it’s ever been detected in a previous test. Reading news about microbiome has taken on a whole new personal meaning when I can see if the discovery relates to me. Next we’ll show you how to make your own charts. 2.6 Analyze your uBiome Results in Python The charts and tables you see in the uBiome Explorer are generated from the same data file that you can download for yourself in the Advanced tab. If you’re comfortable with programming, you can pull that data into your favorite software tools for even more analysis. To get started, look at the open source uBiome Tools Repository which contains source code that will let you: Compare two samples to find the unique organisms in each. Compare two samples and show the differences in counts for each. Merge more than one sample into a single file. For Python programmers, the code is available either in the official uBiome library or as an easy-to-install library hosted on the Python Package Index and installable through PIP. Just type this from the console application on your computer (either Terminal on Mac, or Powershell on Windows). $ pip install ubiome The uBiome package is designed for either Python 2 or 3, and once installed you can use it as a console script, for a new system command like this: &gt; ubiome -h usage: ubiome.py [-h] [-c COMPARE] [-u UNIQUE] [-d DEBUG] sample1 sample2 positional arguments: sample1 filename for a valid uBiome JSON taxonomy file sample2 sample you are comparing to optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit -c COMPARE, --compare COMPARE Compare sample1 with with sample2 -u UNIQUE, --unique UNIQUE Find items in sample1 not in sample2 -d DEBUG, --debug DEBUG turn debug mode to run tests If you have two uBiome-formatted JSON files in the current directory, try this: $ ubiome -c sample1.json sample2.json It will compare the two samples and output a comma-separated (CSV) dump of the differences between them. Similarly, the following command returns the parts of a sample that are unique: $ ubiome -u sample1.json sample2.json &gt; uniques.csv Now you’ll have a new file in your directory, “uniques.csv”, that you can load into any spreadsheet program. The file will have a series of rows representing each taxa of bacteria that are unique, i.e. only found in “sample1.json”. You’ll find both the compare and unique commands useful for understanding the differences between two of your own samples. If you have a sample of yourself before taking probiotics, and another afterwards, for example, this can help you tell what organisms changed and by how much. The uBiome package can of course be imported into Python as the basis of your own scripts and modules. To see how, run the following series of commands in your Python 2+ or 3+ console: $ python &gt;&gt;&gt; from ubiome import * &gt;&gt;&gt; x1 = UbiomeSample(&quot;sample1.json&quot;) &gt;&gt;&gt; x2 = UbiomeSample(&quot;sample2.json&quot;) &gt;&gt;&gt; x = UbiomeMultiSample(x1) &gt;&gt;&gt; x.merge(x2) &gt;&gt;&gt; # continue to merge as many additional samples as you like &gt;&gt;&gt; x.write(&quot;x.csv&quot;) Now your directory will have a new file ‘x.csv’ with all samples merged. The first row is all the taxons ever found in your samples, and the other columns are your different samples, with rows containing the count_norm value for every taxon, including zero values for those taxa that are missing in a particular test. The merged form, called a UbiomeMultiSample, can do even more. For example, continue to merge a few more samples in the example above, and then run this code: samples = x.originalSampleObjects # just the UbiomeSample objects of the merged items diversity = [sample.diversity() for sample in samples] dates = [sample.date for sample in samples] If you have matplotlib on your system and run this: plot(dates,diversity) You will see this chart that plots the diversity of a series of samples over time: See the script ubiome_example.py for a complete example. There are also several user-supplied JSON files for you to try if you want to test your own code on real samples. 2.7 Working with FASTQ files The uBiome JSON taxonomy information will be more than enough for most people new to biology. But for anyone interested in expanding their bioinformatics skills, the raw data files are the place to look. FASTQ files are the text-based results of a run at your sample using one of Illumina’s high-end gene sequencers. For example, the first line in my data is: @NS500457:29:H2HLGAFXX:1:11101:16760:1033 1:N:0:ACTTACA+NTGCGAA This contains information about the gene sequencing hardware uBiome used for this sample. The other lines in the raw text file contain the actual base pairs detected by the sequencer, along with quality information to indicate the certainty of a particular read. In my case, the entire file is over 170,000 lines long, and that’s just one of the eight files in the FASTQ archive. That’s a lot of data! 2.7.1 How sequencing works Each strand of DNA will be read from two directions (called 3-Prime and 5-Prime). This means that a given DNA letter will be read twice (once forward, once backward), so the count field of your JSON file will never show a number less than 2. But 2 is a tiny number that might just be there by chance. For that reason, careful scientists will avoid using any data with such small abundances. uBiome will not release samples with under 3000 reads, so the minimum abundance you should bother with is 2/3000 = 0.07%. Most samples will have far more than 3000 reads (my average is closer to 60,000), so if you want to compare small abundances, you shouldn’t bother with anything less than 0.07%. options(scipen=999) range(sample_data(sprague.genus.norm)$Reads) ## [1] 3053 102864 mean(sample_data(sprague.genus.norm)$Reads) ## [1] 54394.6 plot(sort(sample_data(sprague.genus.norm)$Reads), ylab = &quot;Total Reads Per Sample&quot;, xlab = &quot;Sample&quot;) Because it’s hard to compare low-abundance taxa across many samples that may have wide variations in total read counts, I discount anything with under about 12 reads if you are comparing across samples that are all greater than 10,000 reads, and 42 if you are comparing against those of 3,000 reads. Why those numbers? Because 2/10000 = 0.0002 multiplied by my average of 60000 reads is 12; meanwhile, 0.000.007 % of 60,000 is about 42. These are just rough guidelines – a more thorough calculation would take into account the exact number of reads for all samples. But a conservative scientific approach says it’s better to throw away information that might be low quality. You can do this with the following Phyloseq command: prune_taxa(taxa_sums(gut.norm)&gt;42, gut.norm) 2.7.2 Quality of your FASTQ Here’s how to check the quality of your overall FASTQ file. Sum( use the R1 files count # lines / 4 ) In a Terminal session on OSX, you can check this with the following command. $ gzcat *R1*.fastq.gz | echo $((`wc -l`/4)) A typical result for one of my files is 0.375. 2.7.3 Study your FASTQ online Although it’s possible to analyze this data on my own in a tool like BioPython, it’s much easier to submit the raw data to a public gene processing server, such as the Metagenomics Analysis Server (MG RAST) hosted by Argonne National Labs at this site: http://metagenomics.anl.gov/ Note: You must use the Firefox browser (not Chrome, IE, or Safari), and before submitting any jobs you must apply for a (free) login ID, which you receive by email in a day or two. After logging in with your new account ID, click the “upload” icon on the home page and follow the process to prepare and submit your data: Ignore the part about preparing the meta data; you can add it later. Upload files. The site offers to let you upload from the web browser, but I’ve had better luck using their api and the following curl command: curl -H &quot;auth: webkey&quot; -X POST -F &quot;upload=@/path\\_to\\_file/metagenome.fasta&quot; &quot;&lt;http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/inbox/&gt;&quot; &amp;gt; curl\\_output.txt I just type this from Terminal on my Mac. Note that you’ll need to get your own webkey (hit the ‘view webkey’ button on the submission page) which you will substitute into the curl command line above. Also change the filename part of the “upload=@” section to point to the correct file. Note that uBiome fastq files are compressed, but it’s okay to upload them as-is. You’ll uncompress them on the server after the upload. Manage your inbox. Once the file has successfully uploaded, you’ll see it in your inbox. At this point, you should “unpack selected” if you uploaded a compressed file. Note depending on how busy the server is, it may be minutes or even hours of waiting, and pressing “update inbox” before you see the File Information shown below. Next you’re ready to submit the data Here are my suggestions for this section Check the box to say you won’t supply metadata. Create a new project and select it. Select the files you uploaded Use the default values to choose pipeline options Submit the job, being sure to make the data publicly accessible immediately, to increase the priority. There you go! Now a job has been submitted and you wait for it to complete. It usually takes a day or two to complete, after which you’ll receive an email notification. After that, click the bar chart icon on the upper right of the page: This brings you to an analysis page where you can study your data in much more detail. When I select my data under “Metagenomes” on the analysis page, I’m offered several options for Annotation Sources. Since the uBiome fastq data comes from 16S ribosomal RNA, I choose to compare my data against one of the large databases of known RNA. The popular Greengenes database is one of them, so I select it, and then ask to generate a table of the results. The table, sorted by abundance and filtered to phylum, looks like this: The results roughly conform to what we see from uBiome: the most common organisms are the same in each case, and although the scales are different, the abundance computed corresponds roughly to what we see from the uBiome count field. Other MG RAST tools let you compare your data against other databases of bacteria and proteins, graph the results, and perform sophisticated statistical analysis to determine other unique features of your sample. You can also compare your sample to microbiomes that have been uploaded by others, enabling you to study your results in much more detail. https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ubiome-sequencing-your-microbiome↩ http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/06/150622182034.htm↩ "],

To understand the results of a given test, you’ll want to compare it to other samples, either from yourself at a different point in time, or to other people. This chapter will show how I did that. How Kefir changes the microbiome Experiment 4: The Dentist What changes before and after my dental checkup? Experiment 5: Gut Cleanse Let’s go all the way: clear out all the microbes and watch how they grow back. 3.1 Overall Summary of My Experiments Before we get into specific experiments, let’s look at the overall picture from more than a year’s worth of near-daily samples. Can we confirm or disprove any common ideas about the microbiome? 3.1.1 Variability through time Which are the most common gut taxa? Let’s look first at Phylum level In these boxplot charts, the long box in the middle represents a range between 25 and 75 percentile. The line in the middle of the box is the median, and the other samples are shown as dots outside the middle 50%. Like most westerners, the vast majority of my gut is composed of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with an occasional spike of Actinobacteria or Proteobacteria or Verrucomicrobia. The Genus level reflects this with more detail, and variability: 3.1.2 Firmicutes and obesity We mentioned Firmicutes earlier. Let’s dig more deeply to see how those results look on myself. Let’s test that overall ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes, which is based on a paper published in 200x. The most recent, well-respected review (Walters, Xu, Knight 2014) says flat-out: the ratio changes between normal and obese individuals are not statistically significant overall and therefore should not be considered a general feature distinguishing normal and obese human gut microbiota across populations. And sure enough, this is what it looks like for me: 3.1.3 Diversity The general consensus is that diversity is good: a greater variety of microbes ensures more resillience against the daily threat of invaders. Many people, after taking just one test, often feel either reassured that their diversity is “good” or disappointed that it’s “bad”. But I find that day-to-day variability is great enough that it’s almost never useful to use a single result. For exmaple, here’s my Simpson diversity during a typical week: If I had only tested on Saturday, I may have been disappointed with my 0.86 score. Wait another day or two and, with no significant changes in diet, I was up to 0.92. Moral: don’t take a single result too seriously. To get a sense of how much diversity can vary over a year: Although the blue moving-average line shows apparent stability, there are many days that are far above and below the average. 3.2 How kefir changes the microbiome If you follow the microbiome at all, you’ll eventually discover the benefits of kefir. Google the phrase “one of the most potent probiotic foods available” and you’ll find kefir in all the top results. A recent BBC documentary that tested people after consuming different types of “gut-friendly” foods found that kefir had by far the biggest effect. My interest piqued when, after my disappointment with kombucha, I spoke with a man who happened to mention his good luck with kefir as a solution to his many gut issues. On a doctor’s recommendation, he tried kefir for a number of years with limited success, until — frustrated with the $3/day expense of buying it at Trader Joe’s — he began making it himself at home. “What a difference!” he claimed. Let’s jump to the conclusion: I tried it myself and it’s true. I found a very noticeable change in my gut microbiome — the most significant I’ve seen among my many experiments. Look at my levels of Lactococcus, the main genus of microbe known to be found in kefir: You’ll note that I had none of this microbe until late January, when I started to drink kefir. The two dips after that, one in mid-March and another in early-April, coincide with trips out of town when I was not able to drink my kefir regularly. So it apparently has a big effect on the microbiome. What is this stuff anyway? The first thing to know about kefir is the pronunciation. Say “Keh-FEAR”, with the accent on the second syllable, not “KEE-fur” or “kEH-fir”. The Russian origin of the term is a reminder of a time in the distant past when — it’s unclear exactly where or how — the first batch was prepared and then passed along, its microbial components shared from person to person until it reached today’s status as a popular drink you can buy in most grocery stores. Making it at home brings more benefits than just saving money. Commercially-purchased drinks are subject to unavoidable regulatory, shelf-life, and consistency contraints that are important for business. But more than that, if you believe like I do that microbes are highly-customized to our environments, making at home will ensure that the kefir is well-adapted to your own personal microbial environment. The batch that survives and thrives in your kitchen will, by definition, have proven its ability to withstand whatever whatever conditions you face there. Making it yourself is surprisingly easy. It begins with a bundle of the component microbes, a cauliflower-shaped substance usually called the “grain” or “seed”. Instruction books often tell you to be careful how you handle the grains, but I find them robust enough that I pick them up with my bare fingers. I drop them into a glass of milk left sitting on the counter overnight and — voila! — twenty four hours later, the liquid has turned into kefir. Pull out the kefir grains from that glass, plop it into another, and you’re all set for tomorrow’s batch. Unlike yogurt, which requires heating and a stable temperature, kefir doesn’t appear to care about how it’s handled, so long as you keep it at room temperature and can wait for twenty four hours. The reaction might vary by a few hours if the room is a bit colder or warmer, but otherwise I find it surprisingly consistent. Just set and forget. The ease with which the kefir fermentation happens today begs the question of how the very first kefir grains were created. Nobody knows exactly, but there are people who make them from scratch. I haven’t tried this myself, but apparently a goat-hide bag filled with pasteurized milk and the intestinal flora of a sheep will do, so long as you shake every hour and maintain a constant temperature. Even without going the goat-hide route, I found that getting started was the only hard part of the process. You can order some starter grains online for under $25, but to survive shipping the manufacturers generally give them to you in a freeze-dried form that requires a week or so of preparation before the microbes are fully alive and kicking out drinkable quantities of kefir. I got mine by asking around until I found a neighbor who had been brewing his own. Anyone who makes homemade kefir will be happy to give you some extra grains. The fermentation process causes the grains to multiply, and you will find yourself throwing them out regularly. The grains themselves contain a combination of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc), acetic acid bacteria, and yeast, clumped together with casein (milk proteins) and complex sugars in a matrix of a unique polysaccharide called Kefiran. The nutritional content apparently varies depending on fermentation time and other factors, but there’s a lot of good stuff in there. One study shows the following: A rigorous microbial analysis by an Irish lab recently showed precisely which microbes are present in kefir, at various stages in the fermentation process. This chart shows the composition of ordinary pasteurized milk as it changes from before adding kefir grains (time 0 at the bottom) until 24 hours have passed (top) and the milk has been transformed into just Acetobacter, Lactobacillus, and Leuconostoc. The uBiome test looks only at the 16S ribosomal gene, which unfortunately can’t detect yeasts, so I don’t have an easy way to track the yeasts in the kefir. 3.3 Traveling in Mexico Here’s another trip, this time to Mexico. Let’s start with the conclusions: My microbiome changed noticeably during my trip, but it bounced back in a few weeks. My diversity went up, as you’d expect, as did levels of one particular phylum, Proteobacteria that seems in me to indicate that my body is fighting invaders. Science still knows precious little about the microbiome, though we continue to learn. People are not the only foreigners you meet when you visit another country. Trillions of new microbes, mostly bacteria, will meet you as soon as you cross the border, and many of them won’t get along with the trillions that already inhabit your body. Upon my arrival, I soon learned fortunately, that Mexican microbes are pretty friendly, and with all the tasty food down there, they’re lucky too. “Montezuma’s revenge” is the popular name given to Traveler’s diarrhea, apparently because somebody got sick in Mexico long ago and decided to pin the blame on the Aztec emperor who was killed by the Conquistador Hernán Cortés in 1520. Whatever you call it, studies show up to 50% of international travelers suffer some trouble, and about 80% of the time the culprit is a bacterium. Mexico City has become a serious foodie capital. If you haven’t been there recently, many seasoned travelers suggest you check it again because there has been quite a boom in fine restaurants with tasty dishes from around the world. We ate everything, from queso oaxaca at Mercado de San Juan, to the grasshopper-like insect delicacy ( 60 pesos/100g) chapulines, to the wonderful buttery-tasting fruit called cherimoya. My favorite drink was pulque, a fermented concoction made from the sap of the maguey (agave) plant. Unlike other fermented beverages like kombucha or beer, the fermentation takes place inside the plant, before harvesting. The plants take more than a decade to mature, and when they start to produce, you have to suck out the pulque quickly or it goes bad. Nobody’s figured out how to preserve it without losing flavor and potency, so unfortunately I’m not able to get any in the U.S. I loved the food, but what about my microbes? To find out, I tested myself with uBiome gut kits before leaving, immediately at the end of the trip (‘during’), and then a few weeks later. Here’s the highest level (phylum) summary of the most common bacteria I found: Phylum Before During After Firmicutes 74.71% 67.03% 70.47% Bacteroidetes 21.09% 21.93% 24.04% Verrucomicrobia 0.30% 5.69% 1.26% Proteobacteria 0.99% 3.14% 0.49% Actinobacteria 2.62% 1.57% 2.46% The first thing to notice is the contrast between my microbiome during the trip versus otherwise. Before and after, my gut is normally dominated by the top two phyla, with nothing else breaking higher than 2%, but during the trip the abundances are more evenly spread. In other words, the diversity increased, as you can see in this picture of the changes in my “inverse simpson” diversity metric: It makes sense that diversity would increase on a trip, but what can I learn about the bacteria that changed? Notice how a key one, Proteobacteria, spiked during my trip and then returned to normal after I returned home. I saw the same spike after my jungle trip, during my gut cleanse experiment, and once before when I had been fighting an upset stomach. My experience is consistent with a similar observation by Duke University’s Lawrence David26 and collaborators, who found that this phylum seems to increase during episodes when the gut is under attack, like it is in foreign travel. Whenever I see elevated proteobacteria in somebody’s uBiome results, I always ask them if they’ve noticed anything unusual tummy-wise. Because the uBiome technology is designed for citizen science and not medical purposes, the test won’t tell you if you have common pathogens, like the infamous E. Coli or other nasty ones like Shigella. If you ever suspect an illness, you should immediately see a doctor. We’re not just saying this. By their nature, pathogens are often very similar to benign or even beneficial bacteria, sometimes differing by only a single base pair. If they were too different, evolution would quickly stamp them out. The uBiome test just won’t give you the information you’d need for treatment. That said, at the bacterial DNA level, the Kluyvera genus is quite similar to interesting bacteria like E. Coli or Shigella, and sure enough, I see that it spiked during my trip. Kluyvera ferments sugars and goes up in people on a ketogenic diet, but in this case I bet I’m seeing evidence of a perhaps some kind of an unwanted invader. Next, what might I learn if I study just the bacteria that changed the most ? To do that, I made a list of just those at the genus level that existed before my trip and after, but not during. New things I picked up: Enterococcus Citrobacter Methanomassiliicoccus Flavobacterium Fastidiosipila I then compared this to uBiome’s big database, based on tens of thousands of samples. You can find a chart like this on your Insights tab: Two of these stand out for me: Methanomassiliicoccus and Citrobacter, both of which are rare among uBiome samples and yet they appeared for me just once on a trip to Mexico. Interesting… I didn’t bother showing the whole uBiome chart, but a little further up the list of uBiome database frequency is Fastidiosipila, which again appeared just this once for me. Next, let’s look at the organisms that disappeared while I was in Mexico: Stuff I lost Turicibacter sanguinis Candidatus Soleaferrea Pseudoflavonifractor Candidatus Stoquefichus Comparing these to the uBiome database, I see that all of them are pretty common, seen in at least a quarter of all other uBiome users. Again, it’s odd that they disappeared from my uBiome results during the trip. One of them, Pseudoflavonifractor is associated with successful weight loss. I did gain a few pounds during the trip, but lost it all within a few weeks, maybe because this guy resurrected when I got home? As for the rest, the obvious question– both for the bacteria that I gained and those I lost: is that good or bad? The answer, frustratingly, is that we don’t really know, but here are some obvious questions for follow-up: Are these bacteria somehow associated with Mexico? Like other organisms, some bacteria seem to be native to some geographies and some aren’t. Maybe I’ve stumbled upon a few that happen to enjoy the climate there. I never became sick during my trip. Did some of these new bacteria protect me somehow? If so, what specifically might I do next time to ensure that I can get them again? Few of the bacteria I gained seem to stick around, but I know from past experience living in another country that it does seem possible to make permanent changes. Many people who live for extended periods in Japan, for example, seem to carry a bacterium that’s good at digesting sushi. Maybe there’s a similar one for Mexican food? What about the fermented pulque? Is there some specific health benefit I enjoyed by drinking something that thousands of years of tradition says is good for me? Perhaps with more data we can identify exactly which microbes thrive on this stuff. As a citizen scientist, my purpose isn’t to solve these problems right away, but rather to raise new and hopefully interesting questions that others can follow up together. Studying the differences between my own samples is my biggest advantage over “real” scientists, who generally look at anonymous data and rarely have the context to go deep into interesting questions that might not have been apparent at the start of the experiment. 3.4 Do Probiotics Work? Lots of people take probiotics, thinking that it’s helpful to ingest large amounts of bacteria. Most of the microbes are produced in a manufacturing facility that grows industrial quantities of a few species that have been found in various studies to be helpful for health. But how do you know if the specific one you take is any good for you? To find out, I tracked my microbiome daily while taking a high quality probiotic according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Here’s how I did the analysis. I took a Sound Probiotics pill once per day from October 25 to November 2nd. Whatever it did should have been visible in my gut by the following day. [In all my samples, the notes for each sample apply to the previous day] Begin by loading the necessary data. I also peek at the data using some handy phyloseq commands sprague.norm &lt;- sprague.genus.norm The data is still raw, containing the un-processed abundance data from the Illumina sequencer. Because there are differences in the way the DNA from the microbes are read in each sample (called “reads”), the total number of reads can vary significantly from sample to sample. For that reason, we generally don’t compare the absolute abundances found in each sample; instead we calculate the percentages. In the examples below, I’ll use the normalized values taken from the uBiome JSON count_norm field. Now we’re ready to see much my gut changed while taking probiotics. The most obvious way to check is to look at the overall abundances for the two genera that were in the supplements: targetGenus &lt;- c(&quot;Bifidobacterium&quot;,&quot;Lactobacillus&quot;) #targetGenus &lt;- c(&quot;Bifidobacteriaceae&quot;,&quot;Lactobacillaceae&quot;) 3.4.0.1 Plotting Here are the percentage abundances of the two target genera during the time of the experiment. Remember that I took it on days that are reflected below in the results for all samples from Oct26 to Nov3. library(ggplot2) ps.short &lt;- subset_samples(prune_taxa(taxa_sums(sprague.norm)&gt;0,sprague.norm), Date &gt;= &quot;2016-10-10&quot; &amp; Date &lt; &quot;2016-11-15&quot; &amp; Site ==&quot;gut&quot;) x = which(sample_data(ps.short)$Date == &quot;2016-10-24&quot;) xend = which(sample_data(ps.short)$Date == &quot;2016-11-02&quot;) plot_bar(subset_taxa(ps.short, Genus %in% targetGenus), fill=&quot;Genus&quot;, x=&quot;Date&quot;) + annotate(&quot;segment&quot;,x = as.Date(&quot;2016-10-24&quot;), xend = as.Date(&quot;2016-11-02&quot;), y = -0.003, yend = -0.003, color = &quot;blue&quot;, size = 2) So my first observation is that the supplement didn’t seem to have much effect on the species it claimed to contain. Now, if you were only seeing one or two of these results, you might think the big spike on October 24 and 25th was caused by the probiotic. It’s possible, but given that the abundances plunged again a day or two later, I’m skeptical. In fact, by the time I ended the experiment on November 2nd, practically none of the bacteria in question were showing up. That said, it is curious that abundances popped upwards again after I ended the experiment. Maybe in fact my body had adjusted to the new levels of probiotics, and there was some kind of lag effect that pushed the others out of my system as soon as I stopped taking them. To see how plausible that is, let’s look at a longer time horizon: ps.long &lt;- subset_samples(prune_taxa(taxa_sums(sprague.norm)&gt;0,sprague.norm), Date &gt;= &quot;2016-08-15&quot; &amp; # Date &lt; &quot;2016-12-15&quot; &amp; Site == &quot;gut&quot;) x = which(sample_data(ps.long)$Date == &quot;2016-10-24&quot;) xend = which(sample_data(ps.long)$Date == &quot;2016-11-02&quot;) plot_bar(subset_taxa(ps.long, Genus %in% targetGenus), fill=&quot;Genus&quot;, x=&quot;Date&quot;) + annotate(&quot;segment&quot;,x = as.Date(&quot;2016-10-24&quot;), xend = as.Date(&quot;2016-11-02&quot;), y = -0.003, yend = -0.003, color = &quot;blue&quot;, size = 2) Hmmmm, it seems the levels of those particular genera went back down again, and then up a week or two later. Seen from a longer time horizon, in fact, it’s hard to see much effect of the probiotic at all. Maybe my view of the microbe ecology, hoping to see results in only one or two genera, is too simplistic. We know that the gut is an ecosystem. If you add lots of one type of organism, maybe that affects the abundances and ratios of other microbes, all of whom are in constant competition with one another. Is there a way to tell overall how the microbes are changing? There is a statistical transformation we can apply, called Principal Coordinates Analysis that works, essentially, by looking at all the abundances together and working out which specific microbes seem to correlate most with the others in any given group of samples. In other words, if two different species tend to go up and down together all the time, i.e. are highly correlated, then let’s assume that they are essentially the same unit and combine them for the analysis. The microbes that don’t seem to correlate at all, should be kept distinct. We’ll combine all these different correlations over and over and pick just the two that seem to matter the absolute most, which we’ll plot on a 2-dimensional graph. This process is called “ordination” and here’s I did it for all my samples: sprague.norm.ord &lt;- ordinate(sprague.norm, method = &quot;NMDS&quot;, distance = &quot;bray&quot;) ## Square root transformation ## Wisconsin double standardization ## Run 0 stress 0.08227953 ## Run 1 stress 0.1470045 ## Run 2 stress 0.1525318 ## Run 3 stress 0.1539527 ## Run 4 stress 0.08270306 ## ...

See how the microbial signatures seem to cluster with one another? So I’m confident that, at the high level of being able to distinguish samples by site location, the test is pretty useful. What if I apply the same algorithm to just the gut samples in the time period where I took the probiotics? Here’s the calculation and the resulting ordination chart: sample_data(sprague.norm)$Experiment &lt;- FALSE d &lt;- as.character(sample_data(sprague.norm)$Date) e &lt;- as.character(sample_data(subset_samples(sprague.norm, Date &gt;= &quot;2016-10-24&quot; &amp; Date &lt; &quot;2016-11-02&quot; &amp; !is.na(Date) ) )$Date ) sample_data(sprague.norm)$Experiment &lt;- d %in% e sprague.norm.gut.ord &lt;- ordinate(subset_samples(sprague.norm, Site==&quot;gut&quot; &amp; Date &gt; &quot;2016-01-01&quot;), method = &quot;NMDS&quot;, distance = &quot;bray&quot;) ## Square root transformation ## Wisconsin double standardization ## Run 0 stress 0.1934863 ## Run 1 stress 0.1987221 ## Run 2 stress 0.2013922 ## Run 3 stress 0.1970624 ## Run 4 stress 0.1971089 ## Run 5 stress 0.197274 ## Run 6 stress 0.2025629 ## Run 7 stress 0.1981141 ## Run 8 stress 0.1937696 ## ...

Further analysis required: Study at each phylogenetic level. The current analysis uses an NMDS distance metric that (apparently) considers the entire phylogeny (Need to confirm that). Would I get a different result if I explicitly look only at Genus or Family level? Consider other statistical analysis. Although the two strains contained in the probiotic pill don’t appear to cause a change in the gut microbiome results, are there other changes that can be detected statistically. Perhaps there are other taxa that show a significant change. Other time horizons. Maybe the changes don’t happen immediately. Although at a high level, there doesn’t appear to a noticable lag in the levels of the probiotic strains, perhaps a more sophisticated data transformation would uncover something. 3.5 Visiting the dentist The gut biome is interesting enough, but bacteria colonize just about every part of the body, so here’s an experiment to measure the mouth bacteria and how the varieties shift after a visit to the dentist. The mouth harbors its own unique ecology of bacteria, much of which is entirely unexplored. Scientists from the Forsyth Institute in Boston are at the cutting edge of the research, and have characterized many of the species found in their test subjects mouths, but widespread human trials are still years from producing the kinds of results we see from the gut biome research. So far the research is clear that cavities are almost always caused by one nasty species: Streptococcus Mutans. This bug contains receptors that adhere to the surface of the tooth, creating a slimy biofilm where, under the right conditions it can breed rapidly. Interestingly, just a few hundred bacterial cells is enough for it to begin its work, feeding on glucose to create a reaction that combines with the tool enamel to form plaque. The ever-present lactic acid in the mouth, a critical component of pre-digestion, reacts with the plaque to remove calcium from the tooth, leaving small, ever deepening holes that will destroy the tooth unless the dentist intervenes will a filling. To study the mouth, let’s first load some data: sample_data(sprague.species.norm)$reads &lt;- sample_data(sprague.genus.norm)$Reads mouth.norm &lt;- subset_samples(sprague.genus.norm, Site == &quot;mouth&quot;) mouth.species &lt;- subset_samples(sprague.species.norm, Site == &quot;mouth&quot;) Let’s start with the genus level. How much Streptococcus has been in my mouth, and to the degree that we know at the species level, which types of species are there? as.character(tax_table(mouth.species)[grep(&quot;Strep*&quot;,tax_table(mouth.species))]) ## [1] &quot;Streptococcus thermophilus&quot; &quot;Streptococcus gordonii&quot; ## [3] &quot;Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae&quot; &quot;Streptococcus equinus&quot; ## [5] &quot;Streptococcus agalactiae&quot; &quot;Streptococcus oralis&quot; ## [7] &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot; &quot;Streptococcus gallolyticus&quot; ## [9] &quot;Streptococcus mitis&quot; &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot; ## [11] &quot;Streptococcus peroris&quot; &quot;Streptococcus sp. oral taxon G59&quot; ## [13] &quot;Streptococcus sp.

But what about the cavity-linked S. Mutans: plot_bar(subset_taxa(mouth.norm, Genus == &quot;Streptococcus&quot;), x = &quot;Date&quot;) plot_bar(subset_taxa(mouth.species, Species == &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot;), x = &quot;Date&quot;) s.mutans &lt;- data.frame(abundance=as.vector(otu_table(mouth.species)[&quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot;,]),date=sample_data(mouth.species)$Date, reads=sample_data(mouth.species)$reads) s.mutansB35 &lt;- data.frame(abundance=as.vector(otu_table(mouth.species)[&quot;Streptococcus sp.

It turns out I do have a bit of the cavity-associated S. mutans. But fortunately it was there only for a day. afterMouth[grepl(&quot;Streptococcus&quot;,afterMouth$tax_name),]$tax_name ## [1] Streptococcus Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae ## [3] Streptococcus sanguinis Streptococcus constellatus ## [5] Streptococcus anginosus group Streptococcus sp. oral clone GM006 ## [7] Streptococcus thermophilus Streptococcus oralis ## [9] Streptococcus gordonii ## 250 Levels: [Eubacterium] sulci ... Veillonellaceae Answer: no. And sure enough, my dentist confirms that I have no cavities. Now let’s see how my mouth biome changed as a result of the visit: First I load my uBiome data into two variables, one for each sample: (before``Mouth) and the other from (after``Mouth), after a visit to my dentist. Let’s look at the species that disappeared (went extinct) between the two samples: extinct &lt;- uBiome_sample_unique(beforeMouth,afterMouth) ## count missing.tax_name ## 1 6034 Capnocytophaga granulosa ## 2 4153 Peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone FL008 ## 3 3375 Prevotella sp. oral clone ID019 ## 4 2691 Streptococcus rubneri ## 5 1571 Prevotella buccae Anything in the genus [Capnocytophaga] is an opportunistic pathogen, so I say good riddance. Usually they’re fine, but if your immune system dips they can turn bad. [Streptococcus rubneri] was discovered a couple years ago, so little is known about it. [Prevotella buccae] is more interesting. It seems to be implicated in periodontal disease but that genus is involved too in breaking down proteins and carbohydrates, so it’s difficult to know for sure whether it’s “good” or “bad” in this case. Still, it’s something to watch for my next test. Let’s see which species are new after leaving the dentist’s chair: Change &lt;- uBiome_sample_unique(afterMouth,beforeMouth) ## count missing.tax_name ## 1 3640 bacterium NLAE-zl-P562 ## 2 2725 Streptococcus sanguinis ## 3 2075 Capnocytophaga gingivalis ## 4 1969 Peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone FG014 ## 5 1618 Granulicatella adiacens One of those species, Streptococcus sanguinis looks interesting. [Wikipedia] says this: S. sanguinis is a normal inhabitant of the healthy human mouth where it is particularly found in dental plaque, where it modifies the environment to make it less hospitable for other strains of Streptococcus that cause cavities, such as Streptococcus mutans. Perhaps that’s the reason for my no cavities? If I picked up a strain of bacteria that can outcompete the ones that cause cavities, that would be great news and something I’ll want to nurture in the future. Finally, let’s look at overall numbers. Which species underwent the biggest changes (increase) since the first sample: compare &lt;- uBiome_compare_samples(beforeMouth,afterMouth) ## tax_name count_change ## 64 Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae 62007 ## 68 Veillonella sp. oral taxon 780 8065 ## 41 Neisseria oralis 4693 ## 2 Abiotrophia sp. oral clone P4PA_155 P1 2308 ## 28 Granulicatella elegans 1987 Whoah! That first one, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, looks nasty! [Wikipedia][9] says it may cause pneumonia, though a recent medical journal says more hopefully that it [“treads the fine line between commensal and pathogen”] which is a scientific gobbleygook way of saying nobody has a clue. All the more reason to keep testing, submitting, and getting more data. Keeping S. Mutans at bay is an important way that I’ll try to avoid cavities, so to continue the experiment, I’ll look at what I can do to manipulate the mouth biome, beyond what I eat and drink. A key part of that is how I brush my teeth. Like most Americans, for years I brushed exclusively with one of the name brand toothpastes, usually Crest or Colgate. But looking more closely at the labels, I see two ingredients that will be of interest to my oral microbiome: triclosan and sodium lauryl sulfate, both of which are powerful anti-microbials. In addition, the fluoride in the paste works partly by making the tooth enamel more difficult for bacteria. Pre-modern humans didn’t have toothpaste, and certainly not the antimicrobial kinds that have become popular only in the past generation. Of course, tooth decay was a painful reality for many of our ancestors as well, but there is good evidence that serious teeth problems didn’t begin until the widespread availability of sugar after the European immigration to America five hundred years ago. Skulls of humans before agriculture show almost no tooth decay. Wild animals, including primates like gorillas and chimpanzees get far fewer tooth problems than modern people, another clue that teeth brushing isn’t the whole story. Could it be that a healthy mouth requires a healthy diversity of bacteria, including ones like the S. Sanguinis that out-competes the cavity-causing kinds? But toothpaste with triclosan and other anti-microbials are wide-spectrum: they don’t target just the “bad” cavity-causing organisms. They also kill other species needed for digestion, or to control bad breath. To find out more about whether oral diversity is a good or bad thing, for my continuing mouth experiment I changed toothpaste. Rather than continue with one of the leading fluoride brands, I switched to a more “natural” brand whose ingredient list does not contain antimicrobials. \\[Author’s note: I’ll have the results of this experiment by November 2015 and describe that in the rest of this chapter\\] 3.6 Experiment: Gut Cleanse Microbiome experiments are complicated by the difficulty of holding everything constant. Even if you are careful with precise amounts of the same food and exercise, you are still dealing with your existing microbiome with all its uncertainties, making it difficult to tell precisely what caused a particular change. What if you could wipe the slate clean; start over with a completely new biome and just track that, along with precisely what you eat afterwards? What could you learn? In this experiment, I tried exactly that, using a colon cleanse – the kind you do before a colonoscopy screening. By flushing all the bacteria from my system and carefully watching them grow back with side-by-side uBiome tests, I was able to get a better picture of the resilience of my microbiome. The bottom line: My gut microbiome recovers pretty quickly. Unlike antibiotics, which are known to cause long-term (and possibly permanent) changes, losing bacteria this way seems only to affect the total numbers, but they sprout right back just like a haircut. In two weeks I looked like nothing had happened. Here’s the the summary from uBiome: Notice the big change on the day of the cleanse, followed by a big shift back to normal just a day later. Here’s the functional view of the same data: Amounts and ratios changed, but not the specific organisms. Of course I lost a bunch of bacteria – that was the point – but surprisingly I didn’t seem to gain anything really new, even after an aggressive attempt at re-seeding. I didn’t gain or lose a single phyla. Other than amounts and ratios, I had to dig down to the Class level of the biological hierarchy to find anything that was permanently lost, and even at the very fine-grained Genus level, only two taxa that had been regularly present beforehand were now extinct. (Holdemania and Methanomassiliicoccus). Here’s a look at the key Phylum measure we discussed previously that summarizes how my overall microbiome fared: A couple of weird ones, at small amounts, made a brief appearance. I was especially intrigued by five new taxa that showed up just once, the day after the cleanse, and then disappeared. Maybe I found some that ordinarily get lost in the noise of the microbiome and only show up when the rest of the forest has been cleared. These are some hardy guys and I’m glad I know their names and can watch for them again: Abiotrophia, Bacillus, Catonella, Christensenella, Parvimonas. It’s pretty hard to make a significant change. These days a little googling will find plenty of web sites, books, diets, and supplements that claim to “fix” or “change” your microbiome. I’m a healthy, reasonably fit adult, so I’m not as motivated as somebody with a specific health problem, but I thought simply popping probiotics and eating a variety of new and fermented foods would have a big effect. Nope. There are exceptions – my past experience with sleep hacking demonstrated conclusively to me that I can temporarily change my bifidobacterium levels for example – but those are harder to find than I had hoped. Here’s another important ratio [discussed here] that microbiologists have found useful to see how the gut biome changes: See much change? Me neither. There’s a short spike during the cleanse, but then it just pops back to normal. Next, let’s look at the food I ate during the period: Next: analyze the food to see if there is a relationship between various macronutrients and the levels of specific bacteria such as: Blautia (which likes sugar) Bacteroidetes (which likes carbs) Bifido (which likes fiber) 3.7 Kombucha This is a public data set for analyzing how a gut microbiome is affected by drinking kombucha. You are welcome to study this as much as you like, provided you give your feedback. Contact me on Twitter @sprague or update the Wiki associated with this repository. 3.7.1 Experiment For seven days, from July 27 to August 2, 2016, I drank 48 ounces per day of commercially-purchased kombucha. I tested my gut microbiome with a uBiome Explorer kit each day, as well as my mouth and skin microbiome at intervals during the experiment. The full dataset and analysis tools are on Github: https://github.com/richardsprague/kombucha Diversity through time 3.7.2 Study the data in R You can do some interesting statistical analysis on this data if you use the R programming environment. The sample script kombucha.R will pull all the data into an R environment and draw the following chart: Bifidobacterium Levels 3.7.3 Going further There is much more analysis that can be done with this data. Some of the ideas you might try are: Study correlations among the taxa. Which ones are correlated, and which are not? Which taxa appeared and/or disappeared during the experiment? Is there a relationship between the microbes known to be present in kombucha and those in any of the gut results? How do these results compare to you when you drink kombucha? Please study as much as you like, and let me know what you find! Follow @sprague 3.8 Conclusions Are these results are meaningful enough to be worthy of further analysis? How representative were these samples of my microbiome at the time? I submit only a tiny swab to uBiome’s lab; are the bacteria distributed evenly enough that the size or location of the sample doesn’t matter? Would I get similar results if I submitted two tests from slightly different sites on the same sample? The answers to all these questions are unclear, but while we need to take these concerns seriously, my experience over many samples is that the uBiome results are consistent enough that, yes, the conclusions are actionable as long as we keep the limitations in mind. Here’s why I think so: First, my results are consistent with other “healthy omnivore” submissions that uBiome has received from others with diets and health histories similar to mine. I would be concerned if, for example, my firmicutes/bacteroidetes ratio were reversed. Second, 16S technology has proven accuracy when identifying unique organisms, so I can generally trust information about the overall level of diversity regardless of specific proportions. Since diversity tends to correlate with health – and is manipulable based on what I eat – my own experience shows that the changes I see in these results go up and down consistently in the expected way. Even if specific points on my microbiome map are fuzzy, the overall landmarks appear to be solid. David et al. (2014) http://genomebiology.com/2014/15/7/R89↩ "],
["caseStudies.html", "Chapter 4 Case Studies 4.1 Father and son 4.2 Case study: a baby microbiome 4.3 Alzheimers and the microbiome", " Chapter 4 Case Studies Let’s look at some specific examples: 4.1 Father and son My father and I live in different parts of the country: he’s in the Midwest (where I grew up) and I’m on the West Coast. We’re both healthy omnivores and, other than a couple-decade age difference we both eat roughly similar foods and have similar medical histories. That said, I was surprised to see our gut biomes were so similar. Here’s how I did the comparison. Remember that a gut microbiome varies a lot day-to-day, depending on whatever food we happened to eat, exposure to illness, geographic location, even time of year. To keep the variables as constant as possible, I’ll compare two samples taken on the same day: Dad % Me % Firmicutes 53.8212 46.4356 Bacteroidetes 19.8016 37.5014 Verrucomicrobia 16.8042 2.4382 Proteobacteria 1.7949 12.4340 Actinobacteria 6.6491 0.9072 Euryarchaeota 4.7835 0.0209 At the highest, phylum, level, we can see the percentage abundances look different, but not terribly different. One easy way to spot specific patterns is through a heatmap, like this one: 4.2 Case study: a baby microbiome Molly is a healthy infant whose first-time parents are interested in the microbiome and have tried to do everything they can to optimize their baby’s microbial health. Molly was born vaginally, has never had antibiotics, is exclusively breast-fed by a mother who tries to eat nutritious, organic food. They live in the country, surrounded by nature, including pets and other animals that will become more of her life when she starts to move around. But how can you tell whether their healthy lifestyle is helping? To find out, her parents gave Molly an $89 uBiome gut kit for her one-month birthday. As any parent on diaper duty knows, collecting the, um, sample is pretty easy. They mailed a tiny swab to the lab and a few weeks later they received this list of the kinds of bacteria found along with a breakdown of their percentage abundances: Phylum (Baby) Bacteroidetes 84.59% Actinobacteria 9.18% Proteobacteria 3.97% Firmicutes 2.26% What does this all mean? Well, the first thing to notice about Molly’s microbiome is the dominance of a group of bacteria called Bacteroidetes, and the much lower levels of another type called Firmicutes. In most westerners, the abundance of these two is exactly reversed, as you can see in a similar breakdown we have of Molly’s mom: Phylum (Mom) Firmicutes 50.40% Bacteroidetes 23.04% Verrucomicrobia 8.66% Actinobacteria 7.78% Proteobacteria 1.59% Nitrospirae 0.02% Figure 2: Mom’s microbiome The bacterial kingdom is extremely old and diverse, much more so than the other types of living things around us. The categories Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are therefore very broad, a bit like discussing “vertebrates” and lumping in everything from fish to people as one kind of life. Even at this high level, they have some distinctive features – Firmicutes tends to eat fats, whereas Bacteroidetes likes sugars – but to understand the difference between Molly and her mother, let’s dig more deeply into exactly the types of Firmicutes we see. In adults like Molly’s Mom, we generally find that more than 99% of Firmicutes come from a group of inter-related bacteria called Clostridiales. But not Molly’s. Hers is almost entirely a single species, Phascolarctobacterium faecium. What does it do? Without comparing her to other babies, we don’t really know. How little we understand is just one of the frustrating recurring themes as we study the microbiome. The next big bunch in Molly’s gut is Actinobacteria, of which nearly all is a well-studied species called Bifidobacterium longum. This one is so closely associated with good health that many supplement makers sell it as a prebiotic pill, and Molly has enough to fill a factory: it makes up more than 8% of her entire sample, nearly 100 times more than her mother. Bifidobacteria like milk, and Molly’s are fortunate that she is breastfed. One clue about the importance of breast milk to baby microbes is human milk oligosaccharide (HMO), which despite being the most abundant component of milk, after fat and lactose27, has a chemical structure too complex for the baby to digest! Some early designers of infant formula assumed Nature had made a mistake and tried somewhat arrogantly to market their wares as “scientifically” better because it was simple enough for a baby. But HMOs aren’t there to feed the baby; they nourish the abundant microbes in the infant gut, mostly the Bifidobacteria, and later the Bacteroides that will play a role when it comes time for the baby to begin eating solid foods. At that point, Molly’s microbiota will undergo a big transformation until, by three years old, her gut will look like an adult’s. Turning to the other big phyla, Bacteroidetes, we see here too Molly’s is almost exclusively one species: Bacteroides fragilis, of which her mom (but not her dad) has a tiny bit as well. That makes sense because this particular bacterium is a well-known early infant colonizer, transmitted from mother to child. Some Norwegian scientists, surveying the research, noted its well-known immune system modulating properties: B. fragilis are higher in children with high specific IgE (sIgE). IgE plays a central role in asthma and allergy. Other studies have shown a correlation of B. fragilis with asthma and pollen allergy.28 Now that doesn’t mean Molly herself is predisposed to any of these conditions – in fact, it may mean the exact opposite depending on the amounts or the presence or absence of other species. Again, without studying a lot more babies, we just don’t know. Interestingly, when I looked closely at the broadest levels of bacteria, I couldn’t find a single phylum of microbes that was present in Molly but not in her parents, while I found plenty of examples of the opposite. I guess that’s one more way Molly is dependent on her mommy. Bottle-fed babies, by the way, tend to have more diversity; though my guess is those extra bacteria aren’t all good. One microbe that doesn’t appear in Molly’s sample is Lactobacillus, which is often missing in collicky babies29. Fortunately, Molly seems completely normal for now but this is something to watch for in future tests. There may be an easy fix anyway: get her a sibling. Babies who grow up in homes with other small children tend to have better microbiomes.30 Thanks to the surging interest in gut health, many parents are taking steps to ensure their babies have the best possible microbiome, but until the recent development of low-cost test kits, it was difficult to tell how well it was working. Now Molly’s parents have a new tool, and if you’re changing diapers regularly anyway, why not test your own baby too and share your results with others so that we can all learn more and contribute to the scientific understanding of the baby biome. 4.3 Alzheimers and the microbiome “Anne” is a 40-year-old mother with a secret: her 23andme genetic test results show she is homozygous for the APOE-4 variant, which in slightly-misleading-but-you-know-what-I-mean everyday language means she has the gene for Alzheimer’s disease. Statistics show that about 80% of people like her will develop the condition, and with this particular gene variant, it’s likely she may start to see early symptoms as soon as age 50. Scary! No wonder she doesn’t want anyone to know, including her children and relatives. But Anne is also an optimist: she prefers to see herself as one of the 20% with the gene who won’t develop any symptoms. And she’s ready and motivated to do whatever necessary — diet, exercise, lifestyle changes — to beat this thing. She also knows that her body includes much more than human DNA, that for every human gene like that APOE-4 variant, she is host to as many as ten or a hundred times as many microbial genes, including — perhaps — some that with a bit of nurturing might help offset or prevent whatever propensity her human DNA has to this terrible disease. Scientists researching Alzheimer’s disease have uncovered some intriguing relationships with the microbiome. (see this recent New York Times article for a summary.) Some early AD symptoms, like a loss of smell, may be clues that the brain has been attacked by something that came from outside. The microbiome of the mouth, especially, is an excellent hiding place for low-grade infectious agents thanks to its many dark corners with regular access to both the inside and outside of the body. After reading about these relationships, Anne recently submitted an oral sample to uBiome and shared the results with me. Important caveat before we go further: uBiome kit results are intended for scientific research only. The science of the microbiome is too new to make definitive healthcare-related decisions, and uBiome kits have not been evaluated or approved by regulators. If you are sick, or you need medical guidance, always see a doctor. I am not a doctor! The AD research field has blossomed lately with the realization that the brain, once thought to be completely sterile, is home to many microbes. This discovery and additional research has excited the editors of the respected Journal of Alzheimers Disease, who concluded a recent issue (2016): We propose that infectious agents, including HSV1, Chlamydia pneumonia, and spirochetes, reach the CNS (Central Nervous System) and remain there in latent form. These agents can undergo reactivation in the brain during aging, as the immune system declines…The consequent neuronal damage… occurs recurrently, leading to (or acting as a cofactor for) progressive synaptic dysfunction, neuronal loss, and ultimately Alzheimers Disease. That’s a powerful indictment of specific microbes, and the article calls them out by name. So does Anne have any in her uBiome sample? Unfortunately, here’s where we see both the promise and the limitations of uBiome and others who suspect the microbiome will play an important role in eventually conquering this terrible disease. The promise is intriguing: if we could identify the specific microbes underlying the condition, and then, perhaps through antibiotics or probiotics or some other intervention, what if we could get rid of the “bad” microbes and reseed with the “good” ones? Here’s a high-level (phylum) look at Anne’s oral microbiome: Firmicutes 41.10% Proteobacteria 37.42% Bacteroidetes 12.55% Fusobacteria 5.19% Actinobacteria 3.69% Candidatus Saccharibacteria 0.08% Spirochaetes 0.01% Tenericutes 0.00% Careful readers will immediately notice the Spirochaetes – the same name identified as a suspect in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Research. Is this just a coincidence?! Or have we found a link? At this point, (big groan), we know there are quick-buck charlatans out there who will seize on an observation like this to sell hope to Alzheimer’s sufferers and their families: how about a new anti-Spirochetes supplement? A seven-step “detox” plan to permanently rid your system of Spirochetes? Great idea for a new business, or maybe a best-selling book, right? At uBiome, we’re very serious about science, and part of our mission is to promote citizen science because we believe in the power of normal people like Anne to participate and drive the discoveries that will revolutionize medicine of the future. We’re excited about those possibilities, but unfortunately there are no shortcuts, and real conclusions from this data are still a ways away. It turns out that Spirochaetes is actually quite common in the oral microbiome. It’s a broad category of free-moving bacteria that like to hide in low-oxygen environments. Its most infamous members include the genus Troponema, associated with syphilis, which come to think of it is a disease that affects the brain. (In botany class they like to joke that it’s called spirochete because that’s what you get when you cheat). The Spirochaetes in Anne’s test results are not Troponema, but even if they were it wouldn’t mean much. A lot of people have these. I have some in my own mouth microbiome. The ecology of the mouth is so rich and complex that it’s almost never possible to identify something as either “bad” or “good”. Remember the example from earlier of “viridans” streptococci, the ones that beat back Strep Throat but can also cause heart problems? The same is likely to be true about whatever microbes might be involved with Alzheimer’s. But the good news is that more sampling can play a role in helping to narrow down the microbes that are different in people who go on to develop the disease. If we can collect enough samples from people like Anne, who have a family history and are at high risk for AD, we can compare them to one another as well as to thousands of samples of people who are normal risk and maybe we’ll see a pattern. For example, when Anne compared her mouth biome results with those from a close relative, she found that she has these unique phyla. The relative does not have them: Anne’s Unique Phyla % diff Candidatus Saccharibacteria 0.08% Spirochaetes 0.01% Tenericutes 0.00% Interestingly, this relative has none of her Spirochaetes. And we find two others missing as well. Do they matter? Who knows? The microbiome studies that have been conducted so far on AD patients are too limited to offer suggestions for what Anne can do right now, but slight differences like this offer her some ideas for possible experiments in the meantime. Anne already follows the general advice that doctors give to everyone, including those at risk of AD, who wants a healthy microbiome: get plenty of exercise and sleep, eat healthy unprocessed foods, and avoid antibiotics. But, just possibly, there are variations on these general good habits that might help her today. For example, she’s experimenting with different toothpastes to see how that affects her mouth microbiome. Did you know that most of the common toothpaste brands include powerful antibiotics? Could the difference in brand be responsible for the unique phyla she sees? To learn more about herself, she’s experimenting with alternate brands – testing her oral microbiome before and after to see the effects. This is not the end of the story. Sadly we don’t know what will ultimately happen to Anne. But through better knowledge of herself, and her microbiome, she’s doing everything she can to beat the odds.

It takes up to 500 calories per day for a mother to produce enough breastmilk to feed a child (pregnancy takes only an extra 300), so nature is apparently very serious about getting this right.↩ Bjerke, G A, R Wilson, O Storrø, T Øyen, R Johnsen, and K Rudi. 2011. “Mother-to-Child Transmission of and Multiple-Strain Colonization by Bacteroides Fragilis in a Cohort of Mothers and Their Children.” Applied and Environmental Microbiology 77 (23): 8318–24. doi:10.1128/AEM.05293-11.↩ de Weerth, C., S.

["next.html", "Chapter 5 Go Further 5.1 Beyond Bacteria: 5.2 Fermented Food 5.3 Annotated References 5.4 My favorite books about the microbiome 5.5 Best Academic Papers 5.6 Other Resources", " Chapter 5 Go Further Once you’ve appreciated the importance of the microbiome and its affect on health and more, you may want to expand your knowledge beyond the scope of this book. 5.1 Beyond Bacteria: While technically the microbiome refers to all microbes in and around us, most of the everyday usage of that term is limited to bacteria. But bacteria aren’t the only microbes in you, and it’s possible that they aren’t even the most important. There are fungi, of course, and perhaps other too-tiny-to-see lifeforms like protozoa, but one large class of microbes appears to have a major effect on us but is rarely studied: viruses. Viruses present several problems for scientists. They’re super-tiny for one: you can often fit hundreds of virus-sized particles inside a single bacterium. They’re not always made of DNA, and even when they are, they don’t reproduce on their own.The controversy about whether they should even be considered “alive” is partly due to this lack of reproduction ability, but also because many of them appear to be quite simple: just a sequence of proteins. These characteristics wreak havoc with the traditional scientists’ toolkit for dealing with small objects: they’re too small to study optically without powerful equipment, and their lack of a reproductive mechanism means you can’t easily amplify their quantity, and their RNA components are unstable and difficult to work with. It’s so much easier to deal with bacteria. But thanks to some ingenious and difficult work, a few things are clear. Viruses, like bacteria, are everywhere. In fact, just about every human on earth is infected, right now, with dozens of them. A virus that circulates in your body is considered “latent” if you appear to be none the worse for it, but it’s hard to tell if that’s ultimately good or bad. Humans have been studying viruses for only a few decades, but viruses have been studying us for, well, forever. The chromosomes of virtually every organism on earth shows the tell-tale signs of viral interference. Latent viruses may not cause any obvious symptoms, but they continue to hijack cells, vigorously making copies of themselves, inhabiting every nook and cranny of the body while waiting for something to happen. In mice, and presumably humans, it’s been shown that a particular type of listeria infection is inhibited when a formerly-latent virus gets word that the bacterium is in the body. The listeria pathogen ordinarily causes terrible disease symptoms, but in the presence of a latent herpes virus, nothing happens. The nasty helminth worm, scourge of the tropics and an enemy of humans since time immemorial, actually wakes up the latent herpes virus, which has a sensor fine-tuned to detect it, in turn causing another reaction that will shut down the helminth again. If the virus is not present, guess what: the worm goes about its awful parasitical business; but with the virus, nothing happens. So which is worse: herpes virus or a helminth infection? Best, apparently, is to have both. Trouble awaits the body who has only one or the other. This is true all over evolution and it may explain why some studies are frustratingly hard to reproduce. An experiment that works in one lab, with the same type of animal with the same food, doesn’t work in another lab, no matter how carefully they try to make the experiments identical. Maybe the only difference is that one location happens to have a geographically-specific virus lurking about, and that is just enough to activate a cascade of reactions that nullifies the experiment. What a pain. Much popular microbiome advice suggests that more diversity is better, and intuitively it makes sense that a body with a variety of different microbes has a more robust defense system than somebody with a more restricted microbiome. Whether this is always true among bacteria is open for debate — I for one think it matters a lot which microbes you have, rather than the variety alone — but in the virome there is evidence that more diversity causes more problems. IBD and Crohn’s patients who were carefully studied alongside healthy controls appear to have a wider variety of viruses in their systems. It’s too early to say whether this has any implications for treatment, but it does point out that the story is more complicated than we’d hope. In fact, if you’re not super careful to control for the variety and types of viruses present, it could be that taking a probiotic could be harmful. Your body may have a perfectly good reason that a particular, otherwise beneficial microbe is missing or lower in quantity than in comparable healthy people. Introducing a bacterium that reacts with a latent virus could actually cause more harm than good. There’s no solid evidence for this yet, but if true, it points in the same disturbing direction for treatment that we’ve been afraid to admit all along: the best way to treat any disease is through ordinary food. Don’t go messing with microbes unless you know what you’re doing. 5.1.0.1 The gut phageome http://www.pnas.org/content/113/37/10400.abstract 5.2 Fermented Food Here are a few things to try: Fermented and pickled food Raw milk People have been fermenting food since the distant past, making everything from beer to cheese. Fermentation is an ideal way to preserve food beyond the date at which it is practical to eat. Fermenting your own foods is surprisingly easy. 5.2.1 Yogurt One of the easiest ferments is home-made yogurt. Pour a few cups of whole milk into a saucepan and heat to not-quite-boiling. You’ll need to get it above 160 degrees, the temperature that kills bacteria in milk, but if it goes all the way to boiling the milk will taste scalded. Even that’s not the end of the world, but you may as well try to keep it under that. Use a kitchen thermometer the first few times if you like, but soon you’ll be able to tell intuitively because you’ll see steam rising from the surface of the milk, but no boiling bubbles. After the milk has been heated, remove and pour it into a glass bowl. Let it sit until it cools to about 110 degrees. Here, a kitchen thermometer is more useful, especially the first time because the exact temperature is more important. Warmer than 110 degrees and the lactobacillus yogurt bacteria will die; too much lower and they won’t grow. Once you have the hang of it, you’ll be able to tell based on the touch: it’ll feel unpleasantly warmer than your hand (which should be 98 degrees) but not too warm to touch. Once the milk hits that rough temperature zone, pour in a tiny amount of yogurt from another source. This is called the “starter” yogurt and the best is to use a bit of leftover from your previous batch, but for your first attempt you can use any commercially-purchased yogurt. Sweetened, flavored, non-fat — any kind is okay as long as it has live cultures in it. Be sure not to use too much yogurt. Definitely no more than a tablespoon, and perhaps even just a teaspoon or two. Because of the small amounts, you’ll be tempted to think you need more, but in this case more is definitely not better. Too much starter will suffocate the mixture. Whenever I’ve had an unsuccessful batch it’s almost always due to having too much starter. Mix the starter thoroughly into the lukewarm milk and then cover it up and put it someplace warm. The key is to keep the mixture close to that magical 110 degree point. Some people put it overnight in an oven set to the lowest temperature, but if you don’t like running the oven overnight you can try wrapping it tightly with something that will retain the heat through the night. If have a high-quality thermos-style cooler, you can set it inside there, and some people cover it with thick towels and set it in the warmest part of the house. Another option is to use a heating pad, set to the lowest setting and placed underneath the bowl. The important thing is to keep the mixture at the warm temperatures that the bacteria need in order to breed. Set in a quiet place for about 8-10 hours. Overnight is ideal. When you open the bowl again, you’ll find the mixture no longer resembles milk, but has been transformed into a much thicker consistency — a yogurt. It will taste sour, and if you’re not accustomed to plain, unsweetened yogurt you may even think that is has spoiled. Nope, that’s just how pure, real yogurt is meant to taste. 5.2.2 Pickling The next step after yogurt-making is also easy. It takes a little longer, from one to several weeks, but lets you expand your fermentation skills to many more foods. The most basic one is cabbage, to make your own sauerkraut. Think of fermentation as a type of farming, only instead of large plants that you see, you’re farming with invisible microbes. In both cases the object is to start with a small seed that grows into a full crop. For sauerkraut, the microbes are naturally occurring on the leaves of plants and vegetables. You just need to put them into the right environment so the microbes can grow. Start with a small head of cabbage and a grater. If you don’t have a grater, then just chop it into small pieces. Cabbage is already covered with tiny microbes, but the interesting ones will not reproduce in the presence of oxygen; you need to get them out of the air. The best way to do that is to submerge them in a liquid — in this case we’ll use the naturally occurring water inside the cabbage leaves themselves. The purpose of grating or chopping is simply to let the water escape from the leaves until it covers the entire mixture. You’ll need some type of container to submerge the leaves. Best is something made of glass or ceramic, though any container is fine as long as it doesn’t react with the acids that will be produced by the microbes. A standard mason jar works, for example, or even a cleaned-out jar of pasta sauce. Make sure you have a lid for the container, and make sure the lid doesn’t close too tightly. If you use something with a screw-top lid (like a pasta sauce jar) just pop a few tiny holes in the lid. The microbes will be producing carbon dioxide as they ferment, and you’ll need a way for the gases to leave or the container will explode. Begin packing the cabbage leaves into the container as tightly as possible. While doing this, most people add some salt. The salt serves two purposes; it adds flavor, and it helps draw more water out of the plant. Just a small amount of salt is enough: about what you would use if you were seasoning it for flavor: a few shakes on each cabbage leaf as you peel it is enough, or maybe a total of a tablespoon or two for a small head of cabbage. Continue to pile more leaves into the container until it is full. If you’re doing everything correctly, there will be a nice layer of liquid that completely covers the leaves in the container. Remember that the microbes can’t reproduce if there is air, so covering with liquid is essential. If you see any green leaves poking out of the liquid, pack them down further. It may help to find an insert of some kind to place directly over the leaves, perhaps anthe lid to a smaller sized jar, one that fits inside the container and lets you squish the leaves even tighter. The key is to keep everything submerged in liquid. Put as many cabbage leaves as you can into the container and close the lid, but be careful: the bacteria in the jar will soon start to produce carbon dioxide gas, which will put pressure on the container. That’s the reason for the air holes you poked in the lid beforehand. You may want to cover the entire jar with a loose-fitting piece of cellophane, or an old cloth, as a precaution in case the aroma begins to attract insects. That’s it! Leave the fermenting jar in a cool, undisturbed place and then check on it for the first few days. Make sure the liquid has entirely submerged the cabbage leaves. Within a day or two you’ll also notice some air bubbles in the liquid — the sign that the fermentation has begun to work. Now, just let the jar rest for another several days or more. The longer it sits, the more acidic it will become. If you like a sour taste, let it sit for a week or two, maybe even up to a month or more. If you want a more subtle flavor, take it out in a few days. Feel free to sniff the jar every day or two to decide when you think it’s ready. When finished, it will look and smell like sauerkraut. If some of the leaves were not entirely submerged in liquid, it’s possible that a layer of moldy fungus has appeared, unsightly but not a problem. Just scrape off whatever doesn’t look like sauerkraut and eat the rest. 5.2.3 What’s happening in sauerkraut The transformation from cabbage leaves to sauerkraut happens thanks to a complex interaction of bacteria starting with some members of the Leuconostoc species that occur naturally on the cabbage leaves. These are anaerobic organisms — they can’t live in oxygen. When submerged in the cabbage liquid, however, they thrive, consuming all the sugars they can find and converting them to lactic acid, giving off carbon dioxide as a byproduct. You’ll know the reaction is occurring when you spot tiny bubbles at the surface of the liquid a few hours after beginning the reaction. Sadly for the Leuconostoc, they are too good at what they do. Eventually they’ll consume all of the sugars they find transforming the liquid into a sour concoction, and as result the environment turns too acidic for them and they die. By then, the conditions have become ideal for another species, lactobacillus, which was pretty much designed for acidic liquids, and they finish off the remaining sugars, until the acidic level reaches PH=3, at which point their work is done. Fortunately for humans, the pathogens that could cause us harm are unable to survive in this high-acidic environment, and would be out-competed by the existing microbes anyway, so the final mixture is perfectly healthy. 5.2.4 More fermentation Just about any food can be fermented, as people in all cultures have known since pre-history. Many common ethnic foods, such as miso (soybean) or kimchee (cabbage), are possible only thanks to fermentation. When you eat “cured” bacon or sausage, you are eating something that resulted from a complex interaction between microbes and meat.

Eating on the Wild Side: The Missing Link to Optimum Health By Jo Robinson A highly practical summary of fruits and vegetables: which are good for you and why. Every page is full of interesting, often counter-intuitive tips to eat more healthily. Examples: frozen blueberries are just as healthy as fresh, but broccoli loses most of its nutrition within hours after picking. Carrots cooked with butter are much healthier than raw. In Defense of Food: An Eater’s Manifesto Pollan, Michael If you’re confused about diet, this is the best advice yet: “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants”. Far out theories Plague Time: The New Germ Theory of Disease Ewald, Paul Published in 2002, this book raises the intriguing possibility that most (perhaps all) serious diseases are caused by infections. Certain types of cancers (e.g. HPV) are already known to have viral origins, but imagine how our thinking would change if — when — someday science discovers infectious agents behind other cancers and heart disease. Reading this with other books about the role of microbes has made me far more sensitive to the possibility that science and medicine could one day undergo a huge shift in the way that diseases are diagnosed and treated. 5.4 My favorite books about the microbiome The number of books about the microbiome have exploded in the past few years, but I’ve tried to read (or at least skim) every book I can find. If you’re a newcomer who would like to come up to speed, here’s my ranked list of the best books as of today (November 2016). 5.4.1 Knight, Rob Follow Your Gut: How the Ecosystem in Your Gut Determines Your Health, Mood, and More At only 120 pages, this is the most concise summary of what’s known — and not known — about the microbiome. Written by one of the scientists behind the American Gut Project, it’s a readable and fascinating overview of the facts and a great first introduction. If you only read one book, this is it. 5.4.2 Sonnenburg, Justin The Good Gut: Taking Control of Your Weight, Your Mood, and Your Long-term Health Another concise, well-written summary by a top-notch researcher. This one ties for first place because, well, I’m a fan of uBiome and this one doesn’t focus on American Gut. The science is first-rate, but there is practical advice too, including an appendix of microbiome-friendly recipes. Spector, Tim The Diet Myth: Why the Secret to Health and Weight Loss is Already in Your Gut Another excellent one written by a practicing scientist and a good complement to Follow Your Gut. The author’s concise writing style packs multiple interesting examples and facts on each page. Divided into chapters based on type of food, I learned about what’s proven and what’s unknown about the effects of different diets on health. Collen, Alanna 10% Human: How Your Body’s Microbes Hold the Key to Health and Happiness Another great overview that explains to the ordinary person the implications of the microbiome. Well-written, full of interesting facts, but sticks strictly to mainstream science. For example, although the author explains the concept of “leaky gut”, she observes it skeptically as an unproven hypothesis, rather than jump whole-hog into diagnoses. Best parts discuss the gut role on behavior (“Mind Control”), with detailed examples from autism research, Whipple’s Disease, and more. The book includes a list of the highest-quality references, but unfortunately it’s not complete, so many of the facts are hard to follow up. Blaser,Martin Missing Microbes: How the Overuse of Antibiotics Is Fueling Our Modern Plagues Velasquez-Manoff, Moises An Epidemic of Absence: A New Way of Understanding Allergies and Autoimmune Diseases Another book that explains a provocative idea that our immune systems need regular stimulation by parasites and other infectious agents, or we risk unpleasant side effects in the form of allergies, diabetes, and many other nasty conditions. The remarkable correlation between the hygiene of modernity and the rise of autoimmune diseases makes for powerful evidence that science is far behind in understanding all the consequences of our current lifestyles. Lustgarten, Michael Infectious Burden: The Cause Of Aging And Age-Related Disease Short, practical summary of what’s known about microbial infections, with suggestions for how to manage and treat them. I liked the chapters on the mouth and skin, with practical advice about how to choose toothpaste and soap. Spector, Tim Identically Different: Why We Can Change Our Genes Well-written, concise overview of what’s known about epigenetics and “Fat Genes”, “Gay Genes”, “Infidelity Genes”, “Bacteria Genes” and more. This is the same author of The Diet Myth discussed above, written before he became aware of the microbiome. 5.4.3 Other Books Worth Having in the Pile Matthews, Richard The Symbiont Factor: How the Gut Bacteria Microbiome Redefines Health, Disease and Humanity Heavily researched and footnoted (the last hundred pages are references), it’s an overview of the practical side of what’s known about the microbiome. When I’m looking for a short summary of particular conditions (Parkinsons, Alzheimers), I reach for Dr. Matthews book first. My complaint is that it’s written by a clinician, not a scientist or journalist, and it’s hard to tell when he’s writing from opinion (e.g. his rants against GMOs) or whether there’s a real scientific consensus on something (e.g. the role of Bifidobacterium). 5.4.4 Not Recommended Life is short, so to help you be more efficient, here’s a list of books that I think are a waste of time. Mullin, Gerard E. The Gut Balance Revolution: Boost Your Metabolism, Restore Your Inner Ecology, and Lose the Weight for Good! Although Dr. Mullin has been thinking about the microbiome for years, most of this book is about standard alternative diet advice, with references to Omega-6, FODMAPs, Mediterranean Diet, etc. but not really much specific about the microbiome. Don’t waste your money. Kellman, Raphael The Microbiome Diet Includes the typical formulaic suggestions for how to cure a bad microbiome (Remove! Replace! Reinoculate! Repair!) and lots of sweeping, unproven suggestions for what to eat: “Cinnamon balances blood sugar” with absolutely nothing to connect it to the microbiome. There is a nice list of “superfoods” including natural prebiotics like jicama, but again you must take his word for it that this somehow benefits the microbiome. Just google it and save the effort. Gershon, Michael The Second Brain: The Scientific Basis of Gut Instinct and a groundbreaking new understanding of nervous disorders of the stomach and intestine Although this was a ground-breaking classic when first published in the 1990s, much of the information is obsolete thanks to new technologies, especially the new sequencing methods that gave rise to our understanding of the microbiome. The more recent book, Gut by Giulia Enders is a more up-to-date description of the anatomical aspects of the digestive system, though Gershon is still worth reading because of its details as well as its outsized influence since its publication. 5.4.5 Other Just about any new health book from the past few years will touch on the microbiome, but I didn’t find much specifically microbiome-related that was useful or new in books by David Asprey (“The Bulletproof Diet”), Tim Ferriss’ Four Hour Body, or Chris Kresser’s Paleo Code. You may find these books useful for other reasons, like the detailed discussions of specific foods, but you’ll learn little about the microbiome. The Bulletproof Diet, for example, stresses the now-disproven Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio too much. 5.5 Best Academic Papers If you’re new to the microbiome and would like to dig into the academic papers that drive the field, here’s the selection that I consider required reading. Microbiome science is in its infancy, but its enormous potential makes it an environment rich in highly speculative research, often with results that are overturned rapidly with new discoveries. So before you read anything else, I encourage a peek at this 2014 Nature article by Harvard epidemiology professor William P. Hanage: Microbiome science needs a healthy dose of skepticism 5.5.1 Popular Topics You will find several themes repeated regularly in the popular microbiome press 5.5.1.1 The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio The most recent, well-respected review (Walters, Xu, Knight 2014) says flat-out: the ratio changes between normal and obese individuals are not statistically significant overall and therefore should not be considered a general feature distinguishing normal and obese human gut microbiota across populations. Another study (Finucane 2014) goes into deeper statistical detail to conclude the same thing. Walters William A.,Xu Zech and Knight Rob(2014), Meta-analyses of human gut microbes associated with obesity and IBD, FEBS Letters, 588, doi: 10.1016/j.febslet.2014.09.039 Finucane MM, Sharpton TJ, Laurent TJ, Pollard KS (2014) A Taxonomic Signature of Obesity in the Microbiome? Getting to the Guts of the Matter. PLoS ONE 9(1): e84689. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0084689 5.5.1.2 Obesity and the microbiome Although it’s exciting to think that an obesity cure might be found in the microbiome, the most recent review shows that it’s more difficult than originally thought. Sze, Marc A., and Patrick D. Schloss. “Looking for a Signal in the Noise: Revisiting Obesity and the Microbiome.” mBio 7, no. 4 (September 7, 2016): e01018-16. doi:10.1128/mBio.01018-16. 5.5.1.3 “We are only 10% human” It’s a number based on a guess dating from 1977, but finally updated in 2016: Our analysis updates the widely-cited 10:1 ratio, showing that the number of bacteria in our bodies is actually of the same order as the number of human cells. Indeed, the numbers are similar enough that each defecation event may flip the ratio to favor human cells over bacteria. Sender, R., Fuchs, S., &amp; Milo, R. (2016). Revised estimates for the number of human and bacteria cells in the body. bioRxiv. Cold Spring Harbor Labs Journals. Retrieved from http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/01/06/036103.abstract 5.5.1.4 Cure/cause obesity by FMT Several studies in mice hint that an obese microbiome can be transferred to a skinny one and vice versa: Turnbaugh, P. J., Ley, R. E., Mahowald, M. A., Magrini, V., Mardis, E. R., &amp; Gordon, J. I. (2006). An obesity-associated gut microbiome with increased capacity for energy harvest. Nature, 444(7122), 1027–31. http://doi.org/10.1038/nature05414 5.5.1.5 Moving Pictures Here, we present the largest human microbiota time series analysis to date, covering two individuals at four body sites over 396 timepoints. Don’t miss the 30-second Youtube summary. Caporaso, J. G., Lauber, C. L., Costello, E. K., Berg-Lyons, D., Gonzalez, A., Stombaugh, J., … Kelley, S. (2011). Moving pictures of the human microbiome. Genome Biology, 12(5), R50. http://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2011-12-5-r50 5.5.2 Academic Papers When you’re ready to go to the original sources, be careful: there are tens of thousands of studies, many of them contradictory and quickly out of date. Here are the ones I think deserve to be read first. Historic papers (HMG) Population studies (enterotype, population studies) Specific microbes (Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium, etc.) Methods 5.5.3 General Overview A detailed technical review of how scientists study the microbiome, with an emphasis on how to judge the quality of results. This is a good overview for a smart person who wants an introduction to how we know what we know. (full text) Tyler, Andrea D, Michelle I Smith, and Mark S Silverberg. “Analyzing the Human Microbiome: A ‘How To’ Guide for Physicians.” The American Journal of Gastroenterology 109, no. 7 (July 2014): 983–93. doi:10.1038/ajg.2014.73. Here is another one: Young, Vincent B. “The Role of the Microbiome in Human Health and Disease: An Introduction for Clinicians.” BMJ, March 15, 2017, j831. doi:10.1136/bmj.j831. 5.5.4 Historic Papers The final paper describing conclusions of the Human Microbiome Project: Human, T., Project, M., &amp; Figures, S. (2012). Structure, function and diversity of the healthy human microbiome. Nature, 486(7402), 207–14. http://doi.org/10.1038/nature11234 5.5.5 Self-tracking Track as much as you can about two people for an entire year: their diet, physical activity, and microbiome; look for correlations. Conclusion: the microbiome is remarkably stable and quickly recovers to its baseline. The “Methods” section is especially interesting because it goes into detail on how to find interesting statistical results with such complicated data. David, L. A., Materna, A. C., Friedman, J., Campos-Baptista, M. I., Blackburn, M. C., Perrotta, A., … Alm, E. J. (2014). Host lifestyle affects human microbiota on daily timescales. Genome Biology, 15(7), R89. http://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2014-15-7-r89 5.5.6 Diet Looking for a good overview of studies that link various microbes to diet? The following two papers are the best summaries: Scott, K. P., Gratz, S. W., Sheridan, P. O., Flint, H. J., &amp; Duncan, S. H. (2013). The influence of diet on the gut microbiota. Pharmacological Research, 69(1), 52–60. &lt;http://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2012.10.020&gt; and Portune, Kevin J., Alfonso Benítez-Páez, Eva Maria Gomez Del Pulgar, Victor Cerrudo, and Yolanda Sanz. “Gut Microbiota, Diet and Obesity-Related Disorders - the Good, the Bad and the Future Challenges.” Molecular Nutrition &amp; Food Research, June 2016. doi:10.1002/mnfr.201600252. Here’s another one; see the supplements for details about which foods affect which bacteria. David, Lawrence A., Corinne F. Maurice, Rachel N. Carmody, David B. Gootenberg, Julie E. Button, Benjamin E. Wolfe, Alisha V. Ling, et al. “Diet Rapidly and Reproducibly Alters the Human Gut Microbiome.” Nature 505, no. 7484 (December 11, 2013): 559–63. doi:10.1038/nature12820. 5.5.7 Population studies 5.5.8 Enterotypes The intriguing idea that there may be identifiable patterns in our microbiomes, called enterotypes, was proposed in this highly-cited paper, which includes a detailed methods supplement to show you how to compute it yourself: Arumugam, Manimozhiyan, Jeroen Raes, Eric Pelletier, Denis Le Paslier, Takuji Yamada, Daniel R. Mende, Gabriel R. Fernandes, et al. “Enterotypes of the Human Gut Microbiome.” Nature 473, no. 7346 (May 12, 2011): 174–80. doi:10.1038/nature09944. The idea that identifiable enterotypes may exist has been viewed skeptically in follow-up work. 5.5.9 Large population summaries Twin studies help tease out the different effects of human and microbial DNA. This is a recent update to a study of 1,126 twin pairs: Goodrich, Julia K., Emily R. Davenport, Michelle Beaumont, Matthew A. Jackson, Rob Knight, Carole Ober, Tim D. Spector, Jordana T. Bell, Andrew G. Clark, and Ruth E. Ley. “Genetic Determinants of the Gut Microbiome in UK Twins.” Cell Host &amp; Microbe 19, no. 5 (May 2016): 731–43. doi:10.1016/j.chom.2016.04.017. Two excellent papers present a detailed analysis of the microbiomes and associated phenotypic information from several thousand healthy people in the Belgian Flemish Gut Flora Project (N = 1106) and the Dutch LifeLines-DEEP study (N = 1135). Falony, G., M. Joossens, S. Vieira-Silva, J. Wang, Y. Darzi, K. Faust, A. Kurilshikov, et al. “Population-Level Analysis of Gut Microbiome Variation.” Science 352, no. 6285 (April 29, 2016): 560–64. doi:10.1126/science.aad3503. Zhernakova, A., A. Kurilshikov, M. J. Bonder, E. F. Tigchelaar, M. Schirmer, T. Vatanen, Z. Mujagic, et al. “Population-Based Metagenomics Analysis Reveals Markers for Gut Microbiome Composition and Diversity.” Science 352, no. 6285 (April 29, 2016): 565–69. doi:10.1126/science.aad3369. Be sure to study the supplemental materials, especially Supplement Table 11, which includes details of the specific microbes. 5.5.10 Methods A good overview of the current state of how microbiome analysis is performed, from the sample collection processing, to the data pipeline and final bioinformatics summaries. It includes references to the top platforms (e.g QIME, Mothur, PICRUSt) along with the various tradeoffs of each: Amato, Katherine R. “[An Introduction to Microbiome Analysis for Human Biology Applications](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajhb.22931/full): Amato.” American Journal of Human Biology, October 2016. doi:10.1002/ajhb.22931. 5.6 Other Resources Elizabeth Bik keeps an excellent Microbiome Papers Collection of a few dozen classic academic papers. and you’ll find even more in (Tyler, Smith, and Silverberg 2014), which is strongly recommended.
