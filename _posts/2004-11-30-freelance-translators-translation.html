The Internet changes everything.  Of course it's not a big deal anymore, but I saw this site offering <a href="http://www.proz.com/">Freelance translators, translation services and translation jobs</a>
<br />
<br />I remember ten years ago working as a freelance Japanese translator, making what I thought was big bucks back then -- on the order of $50/hr, as I recall.  Nowadays, between the much better machine translation tools and sites like this, I bet it's very hard to get that sort of money any more.
