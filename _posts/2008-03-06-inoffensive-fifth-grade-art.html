<p>Among the excellent exhibits at last night's <a href="http://www.misd.k12.wa.us/news/frontpage/2008_SHOWCASE_FLYER.pdf">29th Annual Fine Arts Showcase</a> at Mercer Island High School:</p> <p><a title="inoffensive minimalism" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2314733620/"><img alt="inoffensive minimalism" src="http://static.flickr.com/2376/2314733620_71e4aeda57.jpg" border="0"></a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Apparently, this fifth grade class had prepared an exhibit that included one picture that one parent found "offensive", so at the last minute they re-did their pictures this way to ensure that nobody would take offense.</p> <p>I don't know about you, but I find this new display highly offensive!&nbsp; I will be greatly offended if they do not take it down and replace it with the original!</p>
