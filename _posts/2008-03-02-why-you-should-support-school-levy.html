<p>Mercer Island is holding a special election on March 11th for a proposition to authorize the district to levy in the amount of $9,994,000 for the <a href="http://www.misd.k12.wa.us/news/levy_info/default.html">district's Capital Projects Fund</a>.&nbsp; I believe that any proposal to levy property owners should be made with great humility -- after all, we're taking real money from real people -- but in this case I think it's very well-justified and urgently needed -- perhaps the best example you'll ever find of a "good tax".&nbsp; I'm already on record as <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/02/campaigning-for-school-levy.html">strongly supporting this levy</a>, so in the next few posts let me take some time to explain why.  <p>First, note that you won't be paying as high a property tax rate as surrounding communities -- in fact, our rate actually goes <em>down</em> from last year.&nbsp; Look carefully at this chart from the Seattle P-I:  <p><img src="http://www.schoollevyyes.com/images/clip_image001.gif">  <p>Mercer Island has a built-in disadvantage for school funding compared to, say, Bellevue, because we don't have a significant commercial tax base.&nbsp; Of the nine districts in our area, we currently rank <em>last</em> in per pupil expenditures per year in technology.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.horsesass.org/?p=3833">Many people move here because</a> of the schools, but don't get complacent: <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/12/mercer-island-schools-don-make-gold.html">we're not as good as we could be</a>, and unless we keep up the funding, we're going to get worse.</p> <p>I've got a bunch more things to say about this levy, particularly the technology section, and I'll follow up in more detail in posts throughout the next few days.</p>
