Our hearing gets worse as we get older, especially our sensitivity to high-pitched sounds. UK entrepreneur Harry Stapleton turned that problem into a product, called <a href="http://compoundsecurity.co.uk/teenage_control_products.html">Mosquito</a>, that emits an annoying sound that only teenagers can hear. The rest of us can't hear a thing, so if you have a problem with pesky teenagers hanging out near you, just turn on the mosquito and watch them all run away.<br /><br />You can buy it <a href="http://compoundsecurity.co.uk/mosquito_order.html">online </a>for about $1000.<br /><br /><img src="http://compoundsecurity.co.uk/images/product_1.jpg" />
