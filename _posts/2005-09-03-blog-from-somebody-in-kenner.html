I saw this entry apparently <a href="http://www.killoggs.com/log/post/2596191/">from an EMT who visited Kenner last week</a>: "The official estimate was that the town of Kenner was 
<br />going to get ten more feet of water. The first floor 
<br />of the police station would be swamped, the generators 
<br />and radios would be knocked out, and the only 
<br />transportation would be on the single flatboat. Not to 
<br />mention the jail, which would be flooded also. The 
<br />Captain assigned a sergeant to get cheap 
<br />battery-powered walkie-talkies from Wal-Mart�the kind 
<br />you use for hunting or skiing and have a range of a 
<br />few hundred yards�because with the power out, the 
<br />police radios were going to be useless. A lieutenant 
<br />was ordered to come up with a simple system of hand 
<br />communication that the officers could learn in a few 
<br />minutes. Despite all their preparations, the Kenner 
<br />police department was headed back to the Stone Age. "
