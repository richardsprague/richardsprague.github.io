<p><a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/2007/profit/">New York magazine</a> puts a few economists on the trail of various small businesses in Manhattan to identify their business models and see exactly how much money they make.</p> <ul> <li>A private school earns a 10% profit on revenues, with&nbsp;about 54% of its revenue spent on salaries.</li> <li>Cab drivers make only about $12K profit per year.</li> <li>Discount stores (like Jacks 99 cent stores, or presumably like the Japanese dollar store in Seattle) earns $7M profit on $30M revenue for three stores.&nbsp; Their costs are low because they procure goods that are essentially dumped on them for pennies by manufacturers who need to get rid of stuff.</li> <li>Good sushi restaurant in a good location, serving 250 meals per day, earns $8.5M, of which $1.7M is profit. Most restaurants (like small pizzarias) make about 10% profit.</li> <li>Yoga studios make $77K, with $24K in losses, so most are out of business within three years.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're an instructor thinking of starting a studio, it's much better to do private lessons instead.</li></ul> <p>Some other rules for starting a small business:&nbsp; rent for a bar should be no more than your Friday night take and a restaurant's should be about one week's revenue.</p>
