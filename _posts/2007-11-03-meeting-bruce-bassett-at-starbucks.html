<p>Local elections should be <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/09/road-narrows.html">about local issues</a>, so why waste your vote on somebody you've never met, or who isn't already a friend of somebody you know or trust?&nbsp; Endorsements from Big Shots or national political organizations won't help <em>you</em> much the next time your street gets a pothole or your kids' school needs their soccer fields repaired.</p> <p>I like <a href="http://www.electbruce.org">Bruce Bassett</a> because I know him.&nbsp;&nbsp;He's a long-time resident of Mercer Island who has been active in local organizations for many&nbsp;years,&nbsp;long enough to know what matters to normal people.&nbsp;I saw him at the South End Starbucks yesterday and talked to him about the campaign (and his competitor, Patti Darling),&nbsp; downtown traffic issues, and what he thinks about technologies like Wikis and Blogs.</p> <p>See for yourself:&nbsp;click here for a&nbsp;3-min video summary of our chat:</p> <p><a href="http://video.msn.com/video.aspx?vid=feab9255-05ef-4c23-b902-201579518800" target="_new" title="Chat with Bruce Bassett"><img src="http://a1702.g.akamai.net/f/1702/23830/v0001/msnuuv1.download.akamai.com/23830/thumbs/prod/7e/d9/43/c8119021-c428-478f-90e7-9a4e3b43d97e.jpg" border="0" alt="Chat with Bruce Bassett" width="112" height="84"><br />Bruce Bassett for Mercer Island City Council</a> <p>Still trying to figure out how to vote for Position # 5 on November 6th?&nbsp; <a href="mailto:bruce@electbruce.org">Contact Bruce yourself</a> -- I know he'll be more than happy to talk about what matters to you too.</p>
