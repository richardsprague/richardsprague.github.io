<a href="http://www.fortune.com/fortune/print/0,15935,1117906,00.html">Fortune.com</a>has an interview with Bill Gates and Warren Buffet.  Some key quotes:
<br /><blockquote>GATES: It's too bad that economics isn't taught or a hobby for lots of people, because you do run into those who seem to say, 'There's only a certain number of jobs.' That's not the case. Let's say tomorrow we could decide that everyone in India is as rich as we are. Would the world be a better place? Certainly. Would the U.S. thrive more because of the great products and work that would be done over there? Absolutely. The world getting richer is a great thing. It has been a great thing. It will continue to be.</blockquote>
<br />
<br />Gates was influenced by a Fortune article that argues why inheritance money is bad: "<a href="http://www.fortune.com/fortune/articles/0,15114,1116457,00.html">Should You Leave It All to the Children?" </a>[Sept. 29, 1986]
<br />
<br /><blockquote>BUFFETT:It's interesting that the same people who talk about the terrible cycle of dependency that welfare brings will then hand their kids when they emerge from the womb a lifetime supply of food stamps. But some poor woman who's had two pregnancies by the time she's 17, they say, Oh, this is terrible to give her anything. </blockquote>
