I'm so envious of <a href="http://seancrotty.typepad.com/weblog/2006/02/hofstadter_on_a.html">Sean</a>, who went to the lecture by <a href="http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/" target="_blank">Douglas Hofstadter</a> at Stanford on Monday. I read that book in high school and remember attending the author's signing ceremony on one of my very first days at Stanford.<br /><img src="http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/images/GEB-XX.jpg" /><br />His father, a Nobel Prize-winner, taught my freshman physics class. I wonder what that family talks about at Thanksgiving dinners.
