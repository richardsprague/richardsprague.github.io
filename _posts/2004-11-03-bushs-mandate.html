Note that today's election results show that George W. Bush won about 58 million votes. That's the most, by far, of   <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0781450.html">any President in history.</a>
<br />
<br />Combining with his 2000 total of about 50M votes, that means that over 108M people in two elections went to the polls and said yes to Bush over any other challenger.  Compare that to Ronald Reagan's lifetime total of 97M, or Bill Clinton's 92M.  
<br />
<br />In spite of the record turnout, John Kerry's 54M votes won't even match the number that Ronald Reagan got 20 years ago, when the population of the United States was much smaller.
