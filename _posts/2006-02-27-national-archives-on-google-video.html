Just click here to see a 14-min clip made by the National Archives celebrating the first landing on the moon:<br /><br /><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4166049933953240830&q=45017">The Eagle Has Landed 1969 - Google Video</a><br /><br />and tons more.  The videos are generally high quality and don't require you to download anything special to view them.<br /><br />Although the videos are all in the public domain, it's too bad they're not saved as .AVI or some other format that would make them easy to bring in to add to my own videos.
