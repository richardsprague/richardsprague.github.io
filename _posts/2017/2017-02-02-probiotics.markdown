[A Gastroenterologist's Guide to Probiotics](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/770468_print)

[Recommendations for Probiotic Useâ€”2015 Update](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283115625_Recommendations_for_Probiotic_Use-2015_Update?enrichId=rgreq-514eb6ea-8312-477e-b20e-3bb71d437165&enrichSource=Y292ZXJQYWdlOzI4MzExNTYyNTtBUzozMDY0MDYxODIzMjYyNzNAMTQ1MDA2NDMzNDg1Mw%3D%3D&el=1_x_2)
