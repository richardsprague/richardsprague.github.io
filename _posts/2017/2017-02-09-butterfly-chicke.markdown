I can't believe how easy this is.

I made a simple Jamaican rub using a teaspoon or so each of salt and pepper, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, fresh pressed garlic, grated ginger, soy sauce, and apple cider vinegar.

Following the directions from [J. KENJI LÃ“PEZ-ALT](http://www.seriouseats.com/2017/01/the-food-lab-how-to-roast-a-butterflied-spatchcocked-chicken.html) I put it in the oven at 450 degrees and let it roast for 45 minutes.

The whole chicken cost $5 and it tastes yummy!  Why don't we do this more often?
