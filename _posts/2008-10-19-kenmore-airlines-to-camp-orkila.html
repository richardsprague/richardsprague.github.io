<p>As far as I know there’s no law forcing us to do it, but for some reason it seems like all Mercer Island fathers enroll in the <a href="http://www.seattleymca.org/page.cfm?ID=lhPrograms&amp;catId=7&amp;locationID=12" target="_blank">Y-Guides program of the Lake Heights Family YMCA</a>, a highlight of which is when we dutifully schlepp our kids to Camp Orkila, in the San Juan Islands each October.&#160; Usually they try to schedule it on a cold and rainy weekend, but this year it was absolutely beautiful.</p>  <p>The fathers in my tribe were too busy at work to take the 4+ hour trip via ferry, so instead we did something different: we flew on the Northwest’s own <a href="http://www.kenmoreair.com/" target="_blank">Kenmore Airlines</a>, which has a fleet of seaplanes that take off from Lake Union.&#160; I can’t believe I haven’t done this before!&#160; Instead of a long, roundabout drive up I-5 and over a ferry, we were at our destination in only 40 minutes.</p>  <p><a title="Camp Orkila from the air" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2955524127/"><img height="274" alt="Camp Orkila from the air" src="http://static.flickr.com/3043/2955524127_b30c51310d.jpg" width="365" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>The prices are pretty reasonable, considering the time saved.&#160; For about $100/person each way, we saved about a day of our weekend in travel time.&#160; The plane literally landed us right on the beach of <a href="http://www.seattleymca.org/page.cfm?ID=co" target="_blank">Camp Orkila</a>.</p>  <p><a title="Kenmore Air at Camp Orkila beach" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2955484081/"><img alt="Kenmore Air at Camp Orkila beach" src="http://static.flickr.com/3048/2955484081_f71b8cccd3.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>  <p> Getting there is half the fun, of course.&#160; Nothing like flying around the Space Needle in 9-seater airplane.</p> <object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="300" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=61761" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"> <param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=fa06c0609f&amp;photo_id=2956631888"></param> <param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=61761"></param> <param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"></param> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=61761" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=fa06c0609f&amp;photo_id=2956631888" height="300" width="400"></embed></object>  <p>I haven’t had this much fun in the air since last year when a friend took us up in his private plane and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sprague/archive/2007/05/12/flying-over-microsoft.aspx" target="_blank">we flew over Mercer Island.</a></p>
