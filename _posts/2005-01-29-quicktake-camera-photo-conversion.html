I have a whole bunch of old photos taken with an original Apple QuickTake 100 camera in the early 1990s, but I can't view them anymore because the image format is no longer supported. <br /><br />Finally, today I found some information about how to solve the problem.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.macintouch.com/digitalcameras03.html">Macintouch </a>offers the following advice:<br /><blockquote><br />			<p><i>Mike Silverman</i><br><br />			The bad news is that the QuickTake 100 and 150 cameras used a <br />			special, proprietary version of the PICT format to store images. <br />			These can't be opened by anything, including GraphicConverter, <br />			unless you are running on an OS 9 or earlier system with Apple's <br />			special QuickTake image extension installed. Apple has a tech note <br />			about this<br />			<a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=61047">Mac <br />			OS X: Unable to Open QuickTake 100, 150 Pictures</a>, but of course <br />			the tech note is quite unhelpful about actually pointing you to the <br />			necessary software. </p><br />			<p>For that, you have to search Apple's database of obsolete <br />			software, where the QuickTake 1.0 software for PowerMacintosh can be <br />			found:<br />			<a href="http://download.info.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/English-North_American/Macintosh/Display-Peripheral/QuickTake/QuickTake_for_Power_Mac_1.0.sea.bin"><br />			QuickTake_for_Power_Mac_1.0.sea.bin</a> </p><br />			<p>You'll need to find a bona-fide MacOS 9 or earlier PowerMac to <br />			install this on (you can't run it in Classic mode on an OS X box) <br />			but once you do that you can then open the QuickTake pictures, and <br />			save them in another format. </p><br />			<p>If you don't have an old Mac running Classic system software <br />			handy, you can always try your local library, schools, or even <br />			actually buy a first generation PowerMac for $10 or less on eBay.<br />			</p><br />			<br><br />			<i>Christopher Morrison</i><br><br />			Go to<br />			<a href="http://www.info.apple.com/support/oldersoftwarelist.html"><br />			AppleCare Support - Older Software Downloads</a> and look for <br />			&quot;QuickTake_for_Power_Mac_1.0.sea.bin&quot;. I actually converted some old <br />			photos to JPEG format a few days ago, and it works fine in Classic <br />			mode in OS X. </p><br />			<p><br><br />			<i>Craig Colthorp</i><br><br />			I believe that iView Multimedia includes a QuickTake image plug-in <br />			that will read old QuickTake camera images. From there, one can <br />			convert the images to whatever format they wish. </p><br />			<p><i>[QuickTake isn't explicitly listed in the iView site as a <br />			supported format, though that may not be the final answer - <br />			MacInTouch]</i> </p><br />			<p><br><br /><br />			<p><i>Fred Shippey</i> <br><br />			His only option is to find someone with OS 9 AND the necessary <br />			software who will do the conversion for him. Note that there were <br />			two different QuickTake cameras (100 and 150) and they use different <br />			software. </p><br />			<p>By the way, I'm moderating a panel on digital imaging archiving <br />			issues at the I3A leadership conference next week and will use Ken's <br />			comments as one of my &quot;problem&quot; examples. </p><br />			<p><i><br><br />			Robert Patterson</i><br><br />			I searched my OS 9 machine and found that Adobe PhotoDeluxe 2 has <br />			some Apple QuickTake Plugins so it would seem that Adobe might be <br />			able to open them, then save as something else. </p><br />			<p>I also found that Toast Titanium 5.02 had Roxio Photo and in <br />			there, in PlugIns, is an extension called &quot;QuickTake&trade; Image&quot; </p><br />			<p>[Roger Kramer - The Roxio Photo folder (from Toast Titanium 5) <br />			contains iView Media 1.0 that includes a QuickTake image import <br />			plug-in. Have never had QuickTake images so I cannot vouch for its <br />			usability.] </p><br />		</blockquote><br />
