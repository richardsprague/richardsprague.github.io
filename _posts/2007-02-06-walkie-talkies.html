<p>We just bought a couple of Motorola SX700R Talkabout radios for the family to use while hiking and skiing in areas where cell phones don't work.&nbsp;&nbsp;They use a&nbsp;public radio band called GMRS that's licensed specifically for this purpose and is more powerful than the FRS ("Family Radio Service") you get in those cheap kids walkie-talkies.&nbsp; The FCC requires a license ($80 for 5 years) to use GMRS radios, but I just discovered that <a href="http://www.cnp-wireless.com/ArticleArchive/Wireless%20Telecom/2005Q2WT%20GMRS.html">you don't need a license in Canada</a>, which it turns out is where we'll be using them when we go there to ski.<img src="http://www.store.motorola.com/mot/en/US/htdocs/productMgr/images/2way_SX700R.jpg"></p>
