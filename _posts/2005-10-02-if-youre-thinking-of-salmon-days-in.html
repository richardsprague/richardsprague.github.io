<a href="http://www.salmondays.org">Issaquah Salmon Days Festival</a> is not as fun as it looks<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.salmondays.org/home/images/top_header_2005.gif" width=300><br /><br />We went there yesterday. It was very crowded, in spite of the threat of rain, so lots of people must like it. The kids exhibits are fine, especially the one sponsored by AXA where our kids got to make their own toy propeller thingy.<br /><br />You should definitely try to park in a pay-lot, one of the ones closer to downtown. The bus from the offsite lots (we parked near CostCo) take forever to get you there, and cost $1/person--which ends up being the same price as one of the closer lots anyway.<br /><br />We thought the Kiwanis salmon BBQ was a rip-off: $11/adult for not-a-whole-lot-of-food.  And $8/child (over 5).  I'm not sure why they bother serving cole slaw, especially to kids.  Does anybody ever eat it?
