<p>Sixteen years ago this week, I <a href="http://www.scripps.edu/~pulokas/genealogy/LithuaniaPulokasVisit1992.htm">was traveling in my family's ancestral home</a> of Panevezys, Lithuania.&nbsp; A <a href="http://frugaltraveler.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/16/tracing-family-roots-in-vilnius/">New York Times travel writer visited there now</a>, searching for his family roots, just like I did, only he was more successful.</p> <p>What a difference sixteen years can make in the life of a country!&nbsp; The place I visited was terribly poor, and although it was a free country, it had been liberated from the Soviets only six months before I arrived.&nbsp; I saw Russian soldiers everywhere, people paid for everything in rubles, and absolutely nobody spoke any English whatsoever. </p> <p>Of course, during the same period things have changed a lot in the U.S. as well.&nbsp; Average Americans were much poorer back then (per capita <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/p01ar.html">incomes in the U.S. are up 77% in real terms</a> in the past 16 years (15% in the past 4 years).&nbsp; Almost nobody used the internet or email. Cell phones were called "car phones" because they were so bulky, and only rich people had them.&nbsp; Although a lot of people had PCs, they were hard to use -- no Windows back then.&nbsp; Digital cameras?&nbsp; GPS?&nbsp; none of that stuff existed.&nbsp; </p> <p>And what about sixteen years from now?&nbsp; If anything, I'm sure the world will have changed by an <em>even greater</em> amount.&nbsp; You'll be richer (probably at least by double).&nbsp; There'll be new, impossible-to-imagine technologies <em>as significant as the internet </em>in common use. </p> <p>It's so easy to take today's bad news out of its long-term context.&nbsp; Step back a little, though, and you'll become an optimist like me.</p>
