<p><a href="http://www.voteforcero.org/">Mercer Island City Councilman Mike Cero</a> has always been a strong supporter of the environment, especially where it really counts at the local level.&nbsp; On every issue, from HOV lanes to preserving parks to reducing airport noise, he is on the side of preserving quality of life.</p> <p>He's also the the first local official I've seen who is <a href="http://www.nature.org/initiatives/climatechange/calculator/">brave enough to publicly talk</a> about his own family's carbon footprint (in <a href="http://www.mi-reporter.com/articles/2008/04/16/lifestyle/lifestyle3.txt">Nancy Hilliard's column</a> in this week's Mercer Island Reporter):</p> <blockquote> <p>From <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/ind_calculator.html">www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/ind_calculator.html</a>,&nbsp; I calculated [my family of five] at 120,692 pounds, which doesnâ€™t seem too bad given that the average U.S. household of two is 41,500 pounds. According to <a href="http://www.climatecrisis.net/takeaction/carboncalculator">www.climatecrisis.net/takeaction/carboncalculator</a>, we create 14.3 tons, double the average family of about 7.5 tons. At <a href="http://www.nature.org/initiatives/climatechange/calculator">www.nature.org/initiatives/climatechange/calculator</a>, I found my family of five at 78 tons...</p></blockquote> <p>Taking Mike's challenge for my own family, I was disappointed to see that <a href="http://www.nature.org/initiatives/climatechange/calculator/">my household footprint</a> is higher than his:</p> <p><a title="Carbon Footprint" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2420352539/"><img alt="Carbon Footprint" src="http://static.flickr.com/3046/2420352539_a93daef7fe.jpg" border="0"></a></p> <p>I'm not sure why Mike beats me, but I suspect that it might be due to my frequent business trips.&nbsp; I'm going to start doing more to cut down on travel.</p> <p>In honor of this Saturday's <a href="http://www.mercergov.org/Page.asp?NavID=2405">Leap for Green event</a> at Mercer Island Community Center, I think it would be great to see the rest of our public officials follow Mike's lead and publish their own carbon footprints.</p>
