<p><a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/08/raw-milk.html">Nothing beats the taste</a> and nutritional value of <a href="http://www.rawmilk.org">raw milk</a>:&nbsp; fresh, <strike>not cooked</strike> unpasteurized, from cows grazing on real pasture -- the kind I drank as a kid, the kind your ancestors drank for thousands of years.&nbsp; While visiting Vashon Island this weekend, we finally had the chance to stop at <a href="http://kurtwoodfarms.com/">Kurtwood Farms</a>, to see real cows and drink real milk.</p> <p><a title="Kurtwood farm cow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2581926518/"><img height="308" alt="Kurtwood farm cow" src="http://static.flickr.com/3147/2581926518_ac9ef9e2a2.jpg" width="381" border="0"></a></p> <p>Kurt Timmermeister was kind enough to show us the pasture, let us touch the cows, and of course buy some of the fresh, clean milk, which he hand-pours into bottles each day -- about 15 gallons worth, from four cows -- a herd he has been raising for the past few years on a small farm in the middle of the island, right there with pigs, sheep, and a field of corn.</p> <p><a title="Kurt Timmermeister pours milk" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2581932264/"><img alt="Kurt Timmermeister pours milk" src="http://static.flickr.com/3054/2581932264_d706bbb7c2.jpg" border="0"></a></p> <p>He is obsessed with quality and cleanliness. He follows all the regulations, of course, but talking with him I got the sense that he is a meticulous guy anyway, doing this for fun and for the thrill of making a high-quality product.</p> <p>If you think good food only comes from Whole Foods or gourmet restaurants, there's nothing like a visit to a farm to help you understand what your ancestors knew, that real food comes from sun, water, air, and lots of labor.&nbsp; I am extremely grateful for the wonderful variety and low costs possible by specialization and industrial scale agriculture and food processing -- <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/09/do-we-really-need-a-few-billion-locavores/">that's why I'm not a locavore</a> -- but I think everyone should spend the extra money and indulge now and then in the really good stuff. </p> <p>Yummy!</p>
