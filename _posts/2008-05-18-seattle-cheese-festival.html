<p><img src="http://www.seattlecheesefestival.com/img/2007/stage/logo.gif"></p> <p>We love cheese as much as we like <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/05/seattle-best-tofu.html">good tofu</a>, so of course we also dropped in on the <a href="http://www.seattlecheesefestival.com/index.html">Seattle Cheese Festival</a>, held this weekend at Pike Place Market.&nbsp; The best part of course is the sampling (suggested donation $5), though the crowds are disorganized and the lines are long, so you really have to want your samples.</p> <p>Here are the ones we liked best:</p> <ul> <li>Marin French Cheese Company (try their malange brie)</li> <li>Sierra Nevada Cheese Company (excellent traditional and garlic cream cheese, available at PCC)</li> <li>Sartori Reserve (SarVecchio parmesan is best)</li></ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a title="seattle cheese festival" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2503537267/"><img alt="seattle cheese festival" src="http://static.flickr.com/2307/2503537267_97bf06ea91.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
