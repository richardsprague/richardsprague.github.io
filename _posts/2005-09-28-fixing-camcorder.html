I mentioned that my 3CCD Panasonic PV-DV953 camcorder<a href="http://richardsprague.blogspot.com/2005/08/new-camcorders.html">developed some problems.</a>  Today after a few phone calls I found that I need to send it for repairs to:
<br />
<br />Bigston Digital
<br />1590 Touhy Ave
<br />Elk Grove Village, IL 60007
<br />1-888-439-2676
<br />
<br />They charge $261.50 for any repair (includes shipping).  Takes 17-20 business days, up to a maximum of 30 business days if they need to order special parts.
<br />
<br />That's expensive, but still cheaper than buying a new camera.  I'll need to check the web a bit to see what sorts of experiences others have had with Bigston repairs.
