<p>Another reason to support <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/01/mercer-island-farmers-market.html">a farmer's market</a>: a new study of 19 kids from Mercer Island Elementary schools shows significant levels of pesticide residues in kids who eat conventionally-grown versus organic food.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ehponline.org/members/2008/10912/10912.pdf">The study, conducted over a one-year period in 2003-2004</a> showed that the pesticide residue disappears from these kids within a day or two of switching to organic food.</p> <p>Here's the abstract (study by Chensheng Lu, Dana B. Barr, Melanie A. Pearson, and Lance A. Waller)</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>RESULTS</strong>: By substituting organic fresh fruits and vegetables for corresponding<br>conventional food items, the median urinary metabolite concentrations were reduced to<br>non-detected or close to non-detected levels for malathion and chlorpyrifos at the end of<br>5-day organic diet intervention period in both summer and fall seasons. We also<br>observed a seasonal effect on the OP urinary metabolite concentrations, and this<br>seasonality is correspondent to the consumption of fresh produce throughout the year.<br><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong>: The findings from this study demonstrate that dietary intake of OP<br>pesticides represents the major source of exposure in young children.</p></blockquote> <p>One interesting finding: pesticide levels are higher in the winter, even though the kids were eating the same amount of fruits and vegetables.&nbsp; One possible explanation is that they're eating non-local food.&nbsp; It's hard to get organic fruits/vegetables out of season, so kids switch to non-local (conventional) stuff.&nbsp; I think one lesson is that parents should try to get their kids to eat seasonally-grown food, rather than the same ole grapes/carrots/apples all year round.</p> <p>I wish our public schools would serve organic too.</p> <p>[read <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/349263_pesticide30.html?source=rss">more in the Seattle PI</a>]</p>
