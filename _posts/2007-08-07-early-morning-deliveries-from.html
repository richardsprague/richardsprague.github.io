<p>Here's a great reason to use <a href="http://fresh.amazon.com">AmazonFresh</a> (looks like they want you to spell it as one word): 4-hour delivery windows.&nbsp; It's&nbsp;past 10pm right now and I can still order breakfast delivered to my door at 5am.&nbsp; Look at this screen shot:</p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_sDbqdqESbOw/Rrlbte9TPcI/AAAAAAAAADE/tu0yGhXfV64/s1600-h/amazonfresh1+Large+Web+view.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5096205290308844994" style="float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; cursor: hand" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_sDbqdqESbOw/Rrlbte9TPcI/AAAAAAAAADE/tu0yGhXfV64/s400/amazonfresh1+Large+Web+view.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a>  <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Although <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/08/amazon-fresh.html">it's nice to know</a> they'll deliver on such short notice, I'm disappointed at the relatively minimal selection. They carry the standard items you'd expect in a typical grocery store -- a far cry from the <a href="http://sprague.wordpress.com/2006/08/07/the-long-tail-isnt-so-long/">"long tail"</a> of hard-to-find items you expect from Earth's Biggest Bookstore. For example:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Coffee</strong>: basically just Folgers, Starbucks, Tulleys, and a few other national brands. No Espresso Vivace, no Cafe Vita.  <li><strong>Ethnic food:</strong> just your normal salsa, soy sauce, and asian noodles. No furikake.  <li><strong>Bakery</strong>: the fresh bread all comes from the artisan baker, Essential Baking. But if I order it now for deliver in the morning will it be fresh-baked (as in hours old), or will it be 24 hours old?&nbsp; The site doesn't say and I'm not going to take a chance.  <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: boooring.&nbsp; Yes, they have Beechers, which is nice.&nbsp; But no sheep cheese? Come on!</li></ul> <p>Oh, and the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/08/01/remember-webvan-so-does-amazon/trackback/">free pickup</a> they allow at designated pickup locations?&nbsp; For now it's just at Amazon's offices in downtown.&nbsp; I guess that would be convenient if you were an employee, but otherwise nobody would make a special trip there for pickup.</p>
