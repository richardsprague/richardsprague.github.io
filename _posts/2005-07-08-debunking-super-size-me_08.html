Looks like a lot of people have done fact-checking on the Morgan Spurlock <a href="http://richardsprague.blogspot.com/2005/07/super-size-me.html">movie that I watched</a> this week.<br /><br /><ul><li>TechCentralStation runs a page called <a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/supersizecon.html">SuperSizeCon </a>that is full of lots of summaries debunking the movie and book.</li><br /><li><a href="http://spurlockwatch.typepad.com/front/">SpurlockWatch</a> is a blog that regularly updates fallout from the movie and books.</li></ul><br />One interesting link is by Ruth Kava, Director of Nutrition in the American Council on Science and health, who documents the case of <a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/090804G.html">two people who did the 30-day McDonalds-only diet</a> and actually lost weight. She notes that these people chose their McDonalds food more judiciously than Morgan Spurlock apparently did, and they combined their eating with sensible exercise.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
