In America most Christians are members of denominations (Catholic, Baptist, etc.) that oppose research into stem cells, on the grounds that only God can take a life once it's been conceived. But what do other religions think?
<br />
<br />Here's a summary of what Hindus think: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/21/weekinreview/21mishra.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1124629364-OpB9iBMuCFMOGddh7kxxDA">How India Reconciles Hindu Values and Biotech - New York Times</a>
<br />
<br />(basically, Hinduism thinks life begins at conception but it's okay to experiment because it's not possible for science to manipulate what is fundamentally a spiritual existence).
<br />
<br />I wonder what other religions think?  Islam? Shinto? Buddhism?
