One of the best things we found on Mercer Island is access to this wonderful milk delivery service. <a href="http://www.smithbrothersfarms.com/information.html">Smith Brothers Farms</a> brings us fresh dairy products every Thursday morning, for roughly the price we pay in the grocery store. The milk comes directly from the farm, (presumably that means happier-than-average cows ?) and in a blind taste test our kids preferred it to the store-bought stuff.<br /><br /><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/8/1617/400/milkman%20003.jpg" title="" border="0"><br />(here's the milkman bringing his delivery down our driveway)<br /><br /><br />
