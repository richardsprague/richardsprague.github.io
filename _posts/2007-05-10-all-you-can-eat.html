<p>Here's a great idea for those all-you-can-eat restaurants: charge a fixed price for the meal, but add a surcharge for any leftovers. That's what they're doing at <a href="http://centerstagechicago.com/restaurants/sushipara2.html">Sushi Para II</a> in Chicago. Something like $17 for as much as you want to eat, plus $1 for each piece you take but don't finish.</p> <p>[via <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/2007/05/09/a-gluttony-tax/">Freakonomics Blog</a>]</p>
