<img src="http://www.rollyo.com/img/logo-search.gif" /><br />Walt Mossberg <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB113883535053362586.html?mod=djemTECH">writes</a> about the interesting <a href="http://www.rollyo.com">Rollyo </a>search engine. It's kind of like <a href="http://del.icio.us">http://del.icio.us</a>, only you search across a space of web sites.<br /><br />For example, search a "Microsoft"-themed search roll on "<a href="http://www.rollyo.com/search.html?q=speech+recognition&amp;sid=5259">Speech Recognition</a>" and I get only 197 hits--far fewer than the 6M hits that a similar search on Google Microsoft gives. (The whole Google gives more than 60M). And all of the hits appear directly relevant. They should be: they're only from sites that have been hand-selected for this Rollyo roll.<br /><br />The extra-cool factor is how anybody can publish their own roll of sites. So if you're an expert in a particular subject and you have your list of bookmarks that you'd ordinarily consult, you can now share that list with the world.
