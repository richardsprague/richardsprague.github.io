<p>I re-read parts of James Fallows’ short book of China essays <em>Postcards from Tomorrow Square </em>because I was trying to remember his conclusions. I respect Fallows because I liked his thesis from the 1980s, when he concluded that America doesn’t need to copy Japan, but rather should be <em>More Like Us</em>.  But since <em>Postcards </em>was among the first of many books about China that I've blitzkrieged my way through since arriving here two years ago, I like reading it again now with more seasoned eyes.</p><p><iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=richasprag-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;md=10FE9736YVPPT7A0FBG2&amp;asins=0307456242" style="width: 120px; height: 240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p><p>I would summarize his conclusion like this: China is simply too busy holding itself together as it escapes poverty, too busy for America to worry about as a serious rival. Rather than worry, we (Americans) should view China with confidence, helping them avoid some of the natural problems they’ll face on their long road to modernity.</p><p>I agree, though I'm probably more uncomfortable than he is with some of the self-destructive behavior of the American government over the past few years, with its emphasis on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/sprague/statuses/1988088771387392">tougher homeland security</a>, centralization of decision-making, and even <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/12/steve-wozniak-to-the-fcc-keep-the-internet-free/68294/">Internet regulation </a>-- all of which makes me think the United States is trying harder to become more like China than the other way around.</p>
