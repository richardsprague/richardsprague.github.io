<p>I finally was able to attend one of the DIYBio meetings this weekend, and now my mind is reeling from all the interesting possibilities I heard.&#160; <a href="http://diybio.org/">DIYBio</a> is an organization of people who like to study and do amateur experiments in biology.&#160; <a href="http://ensembio.blogspot.com/2003/05/consumer-biology-high-tech-way-i-know.html">Like me</a>, most of the members think state-of-the-art biotech is becoming more accessible to normal people and want to take advantage of it.</p>  <p>The meeting was organized by a guy who has set up his own private lab at an industrial building he rents for $250/month in a rundown part of Seattle.&#160; He’s stocking the lab with used, but usable equipment he buys from eBay:&#160; a $40 PCR machine, for example, plus incubators, reagents, centrifuges, and much more – all at very reasonable, amateur prices.</p>  <p>Here are some of the ideas for DIYBio:</p>  <ul>   <li>“Bio Beer”, just like the real thing only with specially engineered properties to make it glow in the dark, or with built-in resveratrol&#160; (the anti-oxidant that makes red wine so healthy).</li>    <li>Abalone shells: a substance so strong the US Army wants to use it as armor.</li>    <li>Biodiesel, made from specially-engineered high-fat algae.</li>    <li>Bacteria that eat polyethylene, making any plastic biodegradable.</li>    <li><a href="http://theyshallwalk.org/">Theyshallwalk.org,</a> an organization that is making devices to let paraplegics walk.</li>    <li>Artificial meat: go after the <a href="http://www.peta.org/feat_in_vitro_contest.asp">$1M PETA prize</a> for growing chicken breasts without chickens.</li>    <li>Personal genomics: learn more about – and maybe manipulate -- your own <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/10/whats-in-my-genes-results-from-23andme.html">genetic code</a>.</li> </ul>  <p>The concept reminds me of the original Homebrew Computer Club, from California, which I attended a few times myself before its own success caused it to peter out in the mid-1980s.&#160; Just a bunch of amateurs, all with day jobs doing something else, but convinced that the plummeting prices of technology are making for a revolution that we want to join.</p>  <p>&#160;<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/176/439737660_7505789a45_m.jpg" /> </p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p>[flickr photo from <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dullhunk/">dullhunk</a>]</p>
