<p>We moved to Mercer Island from Los Altos, California a few years ago&nbsp;because we thought <a href="http://www.losaltos.k12.ca.us/aboutus/demographics.html">the similar demographics</a> would mean that people have the same high standards for education.&nbsp; It's true that Mercer Island schools are among the best in the state and many people move here just&nbsp;for the quality of the public education. &nbsp;But in spite of virtually identical demographics, people in Mercer Island have a long way to go to match the much higher emphasis on quality schools they have in Los Altos.</p> <p>I happened to visit our old school district yesterday.&nbsp; This picture says it all.</p> <p><img height="297" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2300/1810378037_935dda2472.jpg?v=0" width="448"> </p> <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="345" border="0" unselectable="on"> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top" width="135">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top" align="right" width="106"><strong>Mercer Island</strong></td> <td valign="top" align="right" width="102"><strong>Los Altos</strong></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="135">Students</td> <td valign="top" align="right" width="106">4,102</td> <td valign="top" align="right" width="102">4,299</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="135"># of people with jobs</td> <td valign="top" align="right" width="106">17,080</td> <td valign="top" align="right" width="102">14,979</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="135">Households with &gt;$200K annual income</td> <td valign="top" align="right" width="106">1,556</td> <td valign="top" align="right" width="102">2,355</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="135">School Foundation annual donations</td> <td valign="top" align="right" width="106">$725</td> <td valign="top" align="right" width="102">$1.7M</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>In Los Altos, the "recommended" donation to the <a href="http://www.laefonline.org/">Los Altos Educational Foundation</a>&nbsp;is $600 per family.&nbsp; You don't <em>have</em> to give, and of course some people are unable, but if you have the means,&nbsp;you'll feel&nbsp;guilty if you&nbsp;don't contribute at least that much.</p> <p>Why do people on Mercer Island contribute so little to the <a href="http://www.mercerislandschoolsfoundation.com/">Mercer Island Schools Foundation</a>?&nbsp; Is there a suggested donation?&nbsp; Does anybody feel guilty for not giving?</p>
