<p>Thankfully, in spite of my poor posture and otherwise lack of concern for my musculo-skeletal system, I do not suffer from any out-of-the-ordinary back pain or neck pain or other things that might benefit from a chiropractor or serious orthopedic doctor.&nbsp; But several people I respect recommend Dr. Chen: 425-442-7297.</p> <p>Also see <a href="http://www.dramychen.com/">this web site</a>.</p>
