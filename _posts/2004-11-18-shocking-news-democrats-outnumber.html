<br />
<br />Two new studies show that professors at Stanford and UC Berkeley are overwhelmingly Democrats -- by at least 9:1.
<br />
<br />Possible reasons:
<br />1. Federalist Papers points out that a "small republic" can become dominated by a cohesive faction that using majority voting to outnumber and oppress the rest.
<br />
<br />2. Lakoff thinks it's because academia attracts people interested in "helping society as a whole", which tends to be more consistent with Democrats' values.  This is Robert Bork's view also.
<br />
<br />I think that no matter what the explanation, it's bad news when academia is no longer a place where ideas are debated from all sides.
