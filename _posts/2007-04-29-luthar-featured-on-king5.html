<p>Seattle NBC affiliate KING5 has a <a href="http://www.king5.com/video/index.html?nvid=138354">short news segment</a>t about Suniya Luthar's presentation to Mercer Island parents last week.&nbsp; Nothing new in the broadcast, though it's always nice to see our school on TV.</p> <p>I wonder how they got the video clip of the student smoking marijuana?&nbsp; Did reporter Deborah Feldman ask around until she found a teenager willing to light up on camera?&nbsp; Was he hard to find?&nbsp; Will she (or anyone)&nbsp;help the kid get&nbsp;treatment or counseling?&nbsp; That sounds like a much more interesting story to me because it points to an inconsistency in the way we think about drugs, versus other vices,&nbsp;in schools.&nbsp; What if, instead of a pothead, the segment showed a kid shooting heroin?&nbsp; Or brandishing a gun or a bomb?&nbsp;</p>
