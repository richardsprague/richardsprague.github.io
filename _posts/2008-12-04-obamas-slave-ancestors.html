<p>The country is justifiably excited at the thought of a <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2008466925_obamaslavery04.html" target="_blank">first lady in the White House who is the descendent of a slave</a>.&#160; Michelle Obama’s great-great grandfather, Jim Robinson, born about 1850, lived as a slave on a rice plantation until the Civil War.</p>  <p>So here’s what I’m thinking.&#160; Michelle has a total of 32 great-great-grandparents, just like you and me.&#160; That’s a lot of ancestors, each with his or her own complicated ancestry.&#160;&#160; In fact, thanks to the mathematics of ancestry, it’s pretty likely that one of those 32 people is descended from <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/08/family-reunion-at-mayflower.html" target="_blank">somebody who was on the Mayflower</a>, especially if her family had been in America for a long time.</p>  <p>it turns out that I too have a great-great grandparent who was a slave, (technically, a serf) working under a harsh landlord in the <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/07/visiting-lithuania-in-sixteen-years.html" target="_blank">wilds of Lithuania</a>; forbidden to own property, working long hours for no wages, subject to severe punishment if he tried to escape.&#160; Somehow, thanks to changes in the economy and governments, his son Matthias (my great-grandfather) was able to leave the country and eventually settle in America.</p>  <p>Now, here’s another consequence.&#160; We know that Barack Obama has an African father, so presumably there are no slaves on that side of his family (at least not in America).&#160; But what about his mother (and former Mercer Island resident) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madelyn_and_Stanley_Dunham" target="_blank">Stanley Ann Dunham</a>?&#160; Wouldn’t it be likely that, like me, she too had an ancestor (perhaps a great-great grandmother) who had been born a serf?</p>  <p>A quick scan of Wikipedia indicates that Ann was mainly descended from people of the British Isles (where there was no serfdom in the mid-1800s), so I guess it’s unlikely (though not impossible—remember, all it takes is one who was <em>not</em> from there).&#160; But wouldn’t it be ironic if our new President, like his wife, had a serf/slave great-great grandparent – on his <em>mother’s </em>side?</p>  <p>What an amazingly wonderful country!</p>
