This is an old one, and I'm not sure how I missed it.  Stewart Brand is the California thinker behind the Whole Earth Catalog and a bunch of other hippie-tech ideas dating back from the 70s.  In May 2005 Technology Review, he makes several strong claims about how <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/05/05/issue/feature_earth.asp?p=1">the environmental movement will reverse its position </a>on the following issues over the next 10 years: population growth, urbanization, genetic engineering, and nuclear power.
<br />
<br />I'll add another one: Republicans, not Democrats, will be seen as having the innovative solutions to environmental problems.  Today's Sierra Club, Greenpeace, and others are so anti-Republican that they are turning off mainstream people who are otherwise sympathetic to what's happening to the earth.  Smart environmental organizations are already working to show their appeal to progressives on the right as well as the center-left.
