Generally the mood of this year's Superbowl was pretty sterile, in stark contrast with the risque GoDaddy ad in the first half of the game.  Well it turns out that GoDaddy had planned to air a second ad, but the <a href="http://www.bobparsons.com/index.php?/archives/26-What-happened-to-Go-Daddys-second-Super-Bowl-ad-spot.html">NFL pulled it </a>and substituted a Homer Simpson ad instead.<br /><br />That's fine by me. Their ad was a shameless appeal to prurience anyway.  It got them noticed, but for what?  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
