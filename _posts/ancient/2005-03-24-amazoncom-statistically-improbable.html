<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search-inside/sipshelp.html/ref=sib_sip_help/104-7495217-3372763">Amazon.com: What are Amazon.com Statistically Improbable Phrases?</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />When you search a book on Amazon, they provide a list of Statistically Improbably Phrases (SIPs) that tell you some of the words and phrases that occur more frequently in this book than in others.  What an interesting way to find a summary of a book.  They should expand this to all kinds of things, including shopping and web searches.
