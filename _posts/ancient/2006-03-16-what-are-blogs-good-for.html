<a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/03/14/overwhelmed-with-pitches-dave-say-it-isnt-so/">Scoble is completely right about why people should blog-</a>  Let your friends know what you're up to.  When you have a busy life, it's too hard to stay in touch with people you don't see regularly, like <a href="http://seancrotty.typepad.com/weblog/">Sean </a>or <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/m3sweatt/">M3 </a>-- or friends in Japan I haven't seen in years like <a href="http://nznikki.exblog.jp/">Hasegawa</a>-san.  What cares what we talk about. It's just way more interesting to see what matters to my friends than to read the same old news every day.
