<p>When I arrived <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/06/from-kurtwood-cow-to-me.html">home from Vashon</a> late last night, our mailbox was still there, but sometime between then and mid-morning, some jerk pulled it out of the ground and ran off with it.</p> <p><a title="mailbox torn down" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2586505428/"><img alt="mailbox torn down" src="http://static.flickr.com/3054/2586505428_80346eac93.jpg" border="0"></a></p> <p>They didn't take our neighbor's box (on the left) but that little stump (on the right) is all that remains of ours.&nbsp; The policeman tried to suggest that maybe somebody knocked it over with a car, but that doesn't make sense: why would they steal the whole thing and take it with them?</p> <p>All our important mail (finances, bills, letters from <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/11/clover-coffee.htm">Trabant</a>) goes to our PO Box, so the most a thief would get is maybe a late Fathers Day card or a copy of the <a href="http://www.economist.com">Economist</a>, and besides, the guy took it before the mailman arrived today anyway.&nbsp; ("Are you sure, Daddy?" my daughter asked, "Maybe they wanted the <a href="http://www.ross-simons.com/">Ross-Simons</a> catalog").</p> <p>It clearly was a deliberate act. We found the mailbox later, tossed under a tree on a nearby street.</p> <p><a title="Missing mailbox" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2585667491/"><img height="315" alt="Missing mailbox" src="http://static.flickr.com/3122/2585667491_f16c2f842c.jpg" width="417" border="0"></a></p> <p>What kind of a loser would do such a thing?</p> <p>Our house has an armed security system, plus a web cam that pushes live images to the internet (unfortunately, it doesn't face the mailbox, though). Plus our neighbors all know each other and we talk a lot, so we are all now very wary.</p>
