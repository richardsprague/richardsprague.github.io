<p>There is no point drinking bad coffee if you live in the Seattle area.&#160; In fact, some would argue there's little point living here period, in all this rain, unless you take advantage of the extremely good coffee that's readily available.&#160; But what to do when you're out of town, as I was earlier this month while vacationing on the East Coast?&#160; Well, we had flown into Boston so naturally i made it a point to visit <a href="http://www.terroircoffee.com/">George Howell Coffee Company</a>, in Acton.&#160; It's a bit of a drive, but it was close to where my in-laws live, so we swung by anyway.&#160; There is no retail store, so unfortunately I wasn't able to enjoy any of the coffees on the spot, but I did buy <a href="http://www.terroircoffee.com/store/more_info.php?gid=221">this extremely tasty espresso roast from Konga Co-op</a>, in Ethiopian Yirgacheffe.&#160; Boy is it tasty!&#160; Definitely one of the best espressos I have ever had.&#160; The roasting was absolutely perfect, as good as the best I've tasted in Seattle.</p>  <p>But now I've run out. So yesterday I swung by <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/11/clover-coffee.html">Trabant</a> again to see if they had any Konga (they did a few months ago) but alas, none for a couple of months.&#160; And Terroir distributes through Whole Foods in the Northeast, but not (yet) apparently here.&#160;&#160; Somehow I must find more!</p>  <p><img height="248" src="http://www.terroircoffee.com/store/images/037.jpg" width="153" /></p>  <p>9/25: Update:&#160; Michael from Trabant wrote me to say they now have some in stock!&#160; Iâ€™ll be there this weekend to load up.</p>
