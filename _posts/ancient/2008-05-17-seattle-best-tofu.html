<p> Most of my friends don't like tofu, and I don't blame them. The stuff you buy at the grocery store is so dull it tastes rancid. But I remember the tofu I used to eat in Japan, made fresh by the local tofu-ya, or the excellent blocks from <a href="http://foodhoe.wordpress.com/2007/08/23/san-jose-tofu/">San Jose Tofu in</a> Silicon Valley.&nbsp; It's a completely different flavor, more like fine cheese than anything else.&nbsp; Since moving here a few years ago I haven't had much tofu, since even the local Uwajimaya doesn't stock the really fresh stuff as far as I can tell.</p> <p>Well that all changed this morning when I discovered Northwest Tofu, just east of Rainier on Jackson street in Seattle.&nbsp; It's right around the corner from the Seattle Japanese Language School where I take my daughter each Saturday morning.&nbsp; The make it fresh every day, throughout the day.&nbsp; You can buy it for the unbelievable price of 80 cents per one pound pack. </p> <p>On colder days I sometimes boil it, but on a hot day like today, I just eat it cold right out of the bag.&nbsp; I served it to my 6-year-old, who loves it with a touch of soy sauce. If you like, sprinkle it with some chopped ginger, or Japanese seasonings like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006G5KEY/?tag=afresh-20">furikake</a> or katsu-ou-boshi (available at Uwajimaya). Another option is to cut into slices and pan-fry with some butter (and garlic if you like).&nbsp; Finally, during the summer I often keep some around for grilling, right there with the hamburgers and hotdogs.&nbsp; Again, a touch of soy sauce and the kids love it.</p> <p>One catch: thanks to the outrageous high price of soybeans lately (thanks again, you ignorant biofuels people), the owner has lately been finding it hard sometimes to get the ingredients.&nbsp; He told me he buys from Minnesota, but the price has doubled in the last year and occasionally his supplier can't get him anything.</p> <p><a title="Northwest Tofu factory" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2465006421/"><img alt="Northwest Tofu factory" src="http://static.flickr.com/2324/2465006421_fa85e219c2.jpg" border="0"></a></p> <p>&nbsp;<a title="Northwest Tofu" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2499846020/"><img height="191" alt="Northwest Tofu" src="http://static.flickr.com/2119/2499846020_9b989dbf07.jpg" width="255" border="0"></a></p> <p>It's part of a Chinese restaurant that apparently specializes in tofu and caters apparently mostly to Chinese--I was the only native English speaker inside when I visited.&nbsp; Here's the exact address:</p> <p>1913 S Jackson St<br>Seattle, WA 98144 <br><strong>(206) 328-8320</strong> </p> <p> But if you just want tofu, drive your car all the way around the back and go through the (clearly-marked) door where you can buy it straight from the guy while he makes it.&nbsp; Mmmmmm!!</p>
