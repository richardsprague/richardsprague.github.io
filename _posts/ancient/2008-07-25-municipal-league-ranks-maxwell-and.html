<p><a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/06/why-you-should-not-vote.html">It's dangerous to vote</a> if you don't know what you're doing, and it can be hard to get facts if you're a normal person.&nbsp; You can read the newspaper, or follow other mass media, but they don't often go in-depth on candidates--and they have their own biases whether they admit it or not.&nbsp; Fortunately, and partly thanks to the Progressive Movement (started by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_M._La_Follette,_Sr.">my Wisconsin ancestors</a>) in the early 1900s, you can get independent, objective evaluations of candidate qualifications from the <a href="http://www.munileague.org/">Municipal League</a>, which has a King County branch that is a 501(c)(4) non-profit that's been around since 1910.</p> <p>They just published their <a href="http://www.munileague.org/candidate-evaluations/previous-ratings/2008/2008-legislative-district-32-1">evaluations of the candidates running for District 41</a> (Mercer Island, Bellevue, and Renton) and here are the results for my two favorites:</p> <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="450" border="2"> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top" width="125"><strong>Candidate</strong></td> <td valign="top" width="84"><strong>Rating</strong></td> <td valign="top" width="102"><strong>Questionnaire</strong></td> <td valign="top" width="131"><strong>Web site</strong></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="124">Marcie Maxwell</td> <td valign="top" width="84">Good</td> <td valign="top" width="102"><a href="http://www.munileague.org/candidate-evaluations/previous-ratings/2008/2008-candidate-questionnaires/Maxwell.pdf">Questionnaire</a></td> <td valign="top" width="129"><a title="Campaign Website" href="http://www.marciemaxwell.org/">Campaign Website</a></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="123">Steve Litzow</td> <td valign="top" width="84">Very Good</td> <td valign="top" width="102"><a href="http://www.munileague.org/candidate-evaluations/previous-ratings/2008/2008-candidate-questionnaires/Litzow.pdf">Questionnaire</a></td> <td valign="top" width="127"><a title="Campaign Website" href="http://www.stevelitzow.com/">Campaign Website</a></td></tr></tbody></table> <p>I was surprised at the League's thoroughness and objectivity.&nbsp; Somebody from their org who saw my posts (<a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/07/who-is-steve-litzow.html">Steve Litzow</a>, <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/06/who-is-marcie-maxwell.html">Marcie Maxwell</a>) contacted me directly to ask if I had more background information. At first I was skeptical about the League, thinking that if it's staffed by volunteers, it would no doubt be packed with partisans from one side or another.&nbsp; But after talking to them, I think it would be hard to manipulate their results.&nbsp; The decision-making process is pretty objective: they just want to know if the person is qualified.&nbsp; The person who contacted me asked if I knew other facts about the candidates: things like criminal record, education, employment history, etc. -- basically a reference check to confirm that everything on the questionnaire was up to snuff.&nbsp; </p> <p>So why did Steve Litzow get a better rating?&nbsp; I suspect it was the in-person interviews, which I bet he handled better.&nbsp; Marcie's campaign depends on <a href="http://marciemaxwell.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=29">the lead in endorsements she enjoys</a> from many well-organized groups--each of which has its own reasons for supporting her over Steve.&nbsp; But endorsements represent a tricky calculation that takes into account many factors, including the likelihood that the candidate will win--and not necessarily whether the candidate is "best" for the district. Steve's campaign, perhaps of necessity, depends less on endorsements and more on one-on-one persuasion and how well he articulates his issues--all of which make for a better in-person interview.&nbsp; "Vote for me because so-and-so endorsed me" works better on a questionnaire, but in-person you need to say persuasively "vote for me because I'll do X and Y".</p> <p>Note that this does <em>not</em> mean Steve is necessarily better for you or for District 41.&nbsp; You may not want X and Y.&nbsp;&nbsp; But if you do, then I bet the League's ratings are accurate.</p>
