<p>Very sad news in my inbox this morning.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.anitarowland.com/">Anita Rowland,</a> a blogger friend, passed away yesterday after a long bout with cancer. Her death is especially sad because, although I only met her face-to-face a few times, I felt like she was my neighbor.&nbsp; I knew her as the organizer of <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2006/02/seattle-weblog-meetups.html">a blogger meetup</a> at Crossroads in Bellevue each month, often attended by people like <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/12/10/seattle-blogging-pioneer-dies/trackback/">Robert Scoble</a> and <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/">Dare</a> and many others who through their blogs feel like close friends but whom I rarely, if ever, see face to face.&nbsp; Although Anita had been ill for a long time, you wouldn't have known it unless you paid close attention -- she was just always friendly, nice, and a true connector who liked blogs as a way to put people together.&nbsp; I know <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/10/jump-start-your-prius.html#c5124731171955166243">she read</a> my blog, and I read hers, like neighbors who keep in touch just because they're neighbors.&nbsp; It's so awful to hear that she's gone. </p>
