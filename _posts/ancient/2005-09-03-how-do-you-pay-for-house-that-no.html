Slate's Avi Zenilman answers the question: <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2125583/?nav=navoa"> How do you pay for a house that no longer exists?</a>
<br />
<br />FEMA sends you to the Small Business Administration for a disaster recovery loan: up to $200K for your house and $40K for personal property. FEMA can pay if you just can't afford the loan.
