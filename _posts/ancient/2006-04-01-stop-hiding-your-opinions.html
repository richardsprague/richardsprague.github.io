If a journalist holds shares in a company he writes about, you assume ethics would compel him to disclose that fact, no matter how "objective" he claims to be. But if a journalist holds opinions about a matter of politics, why don't we ask that the same rule apply? If <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/92782/">virtually all mainstream reporters</a> voted against George W. Bush, how can they pretend that doesn't affect their coverage of his policies? (I would add, "or vice versa", but come on...)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2139042/">The Twilight of Objectivity By Michael Kinsley</a> argues that journalism ought to get rid of its pretense of objectivity. I've said this for a long time. I enjoy reading the <a href="http://www.eonomist.com">Economist </a>for its honesty; wouldn't the New York Times be better off if it were the same?<br /><br /><a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002977.html">Mark Liberman</a> counters that Kinsley's take is a slur against linguistics, but why? Isn't the study of pragmatics, <a href="http://www.ux1.eiu.edu/~cfbxb/class/1900/prag/grice.htm">Grice's Maxims,</a> or for that matter anything by <a href="http://richardsprague.blogspot.com/2004/11/george-lakoff.html">George Lakoff</a>, just proof that words are almost never a pure unopinionated representation of objective reality?
