<p>I'm going on a press tour soon, something I haven't done in a while, so this week I attended a special training class that our agency conducts for people like me. The instructor, Betsy, is an old pro who worked as a television reporter for many years and really knows the business. I was particularly interested in learning techniques for dealing with a journalist who is less than friendly, perhaps hostile and predisposed to report negatively.  <p>Here's some of what I learned:  <ul> <li>News articles are called "stories" for a reason, so make your information memorable, through personal anecdotes, colorful language, or proof points.  <li>Don't talk unless you're ready. Unless it's a live TV interview, dead air is your friend. Go ahead and pause as long as you like, until you know precisely what you want to say and how. <li>Quit when you're ahead. When you say transition words like "in additional" or "plus", that's usually your cue that you need to shut up and wait for another question.  <li>Bring it back to customers, particularly on tough questions. Say "our customers tell usâ€¦"</li></ul> <p>The highlight of the class was the practice interviews. Here's my first one of the day, with me trying to explain our product. What do you think? Should I try to say "really" more often?  <p>&nbsp;</p><embed pluginspage="http://macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" src="http://images.soapbox.msn.com/flash/soapbox1_1.swf" width="432" height="364" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" flashvars="c=v&amp;v=16a84d33-2535-454a-8b89-df9bcb14fe0d" wmode="transparent" quality="high"></embed><br><a title="Interview Question #1" href="http://soapbox.msn.com/video.aspx?vid=16a84d33-2535-454a-8b89-df9bcb14fe0d" target="_new">Video: Interview Question #1</a>
