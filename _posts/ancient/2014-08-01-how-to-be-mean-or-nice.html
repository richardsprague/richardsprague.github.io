<p>I don’t believe there are very many truly mean people in the world, certainly not in professional situations where long-term reputations matter. But just because somebody doesn’t have mean intent doesn’t imply they aren’t behaving in a mean way. Consider the following different sentences:</p><ul><li>Did you lose the keys again?</li><li>Did you lose the keys?</li><li>The keys are missing. Any idea where they are?</li><li>I can’t find the keys.</li></ul><p>All of these statements map onto the same reaction we’d like to get from the listener: a sense that something is wrong with the keys, and a plea for some help rectifying the situation. But it’s the <em>way</em> things are said that makes a difference; the statements at the top of the list are <em>mean</em> ways of saying things that could have been said using a phrase at the lower end of the list.</p><p>So I’d like to suggest that people try to say things the nice way. Don’t be mean.</p>
