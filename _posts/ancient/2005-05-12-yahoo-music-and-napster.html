<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/may2005/tc20050512_5257_tc057.htm">Yahoo's Music Rivals Sing the Blues</a>: "But while the music service's opening day was free for users, it cost its competitors dearly. RealNetworks (RNWK ) and Napster (NAPS ), two companies that offer similar music subscription services, saw their stock fall by 20% and 27%, respectively, by the close of trading the following day. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL ), the leader in online music with its iTunes MP3 downloading service, saw shares drop by as much as 7% before finishing the day off almost 3%. "
<br />
<br />I guess I'm glad I didn't follow my <a href="http://richardsprague.blogspot.com/2005/03/investment-ideas-in-consumer.html">advice </a>and load up on NAPS or RNWK.  But the S&P analyst quoted above is missing the whole point of Napster, which is the "to-go" aspect.  Yahoo! doesn't do that, and it's not clear they can do that any time soon.  Right now I don't see anything in Yahoo! Music other than a cheaper version of Rhapsody--great if you're plugged into a high-speed Internet connection, but not otherwise.
