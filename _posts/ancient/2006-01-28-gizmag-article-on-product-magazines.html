Here's an idea: <a href="http://www.gizmag.com/go/4953/">On-product magazines </a>, little magazinelets attached to common grocery store consumer products like bottled water. The pages are designed to withstand refrigeration without going bad with condensation.<br /><img src="http://www.gizmag.com/watermark.php?p=4953_21010661818.jpg" width="400" /><br /><br />The company that makes it, ModernMedia Concepts, apparently has a patent on the idea, but I wonder how defensible it is. Spitfire Ventures' <a href="http://www.fingertipbooks.com/">FingerTip books</a>, is very similar and probably more durable.
