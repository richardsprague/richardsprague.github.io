<p>While spending time here for Thanksgiving, I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.stumptowncoffee.com/">Stumphouse Coffee Roasters</a>, an excellent cafe with stores in several locations including here in downtown Portland (3rd and Pine).&nbsp; Top-of-the-line fresh hand-roasted taste, free Internet, and cheaper than Starbucks ($2.60 for an 8oz latte).&nbsp; What more could you need?</p> <p>Unfortunately they're not open till 7am, so the familiy is awake before I can venture out.&nbsp;</p>
