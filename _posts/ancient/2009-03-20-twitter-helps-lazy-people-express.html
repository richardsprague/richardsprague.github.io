<p>I think I finally understand the appeal of Twitter and why it’s making it harder and harder for me to get excited about blogging.&#160; </p>  <p>For all the talk about how blogs have dumbed down the world’s discourse, the fact is that most of us take a certain amount of time before we post.&#160; Much as I’d like to write more often, the process of creating something readable just takes too much effort, and it means I write only a fraction of the things I would write if I had more time.</p>  <p>But with Twitter’s 140 character limitation, I don’t worry about the time constraint.&#160; I just whip something out:&#160; very brief and very ephemeral.&#160; Ultimately that’s the seductive appeal of Twitter: the short message FORCES me to set aside the universe of things I’d like to write and focus just on the things I CAN write in the here and now.</p>  <p>Plus, Twitter space is full of so much crap that, paradoxically, it makes me MORE LIKELY to write, since it feels like nobody will be taking it seriously anyway.&#160; </p>  <p>That said, i do feel that Twitter is more of a fad than a permanent fixture of the future.&#160; Ultimately it will have to be replaced by something a little more substantive, something more worth reading.&#160; The signal to noise ratio on Twitter seems to be dropping over time and eventually I’ll seek out something with more staying power.&#160; But for now I’m having a blast.</p>
