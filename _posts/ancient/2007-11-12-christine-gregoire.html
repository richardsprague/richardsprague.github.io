<p>We moved into a <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/microsoft/2004007121_microsoft11.html">brand new office building</a> today&nbsp;this morning and look who was there to greet us:</p> <p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2098/1992703742_33337a6270.jpg?v=0"> </p> <p>I was waiting in line at the espresso bar (free drinks today!) and she just walked right in.&nbsp; She says yes they're going to build a new 520 in spite of the failure of RTID.&nbsp; And <a href="http://soundpolitics.com/archives/009633.html">she's crossing her fingers about 4204</a>.&nbsp; (I'd tell you more but I'm forbidden to blog about it :-)</p>
