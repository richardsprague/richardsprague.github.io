<p><a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/08/50-maureen-judge-signs.html">She pulled her signs</a> today, right after I received a response from a friend of her campaign insisting that she has every right to keep them up.&nbsp; Off-island people don't understand how annoying it is to drive past those signs every day, especially when the election's not till November.&nbsp; Thank you for cleaning up.</p> <p>Now when's somebody going to take down those Jane Hague signs on Island Crest Way?</p>
