Apparently there is this thing called <a href="http://www.lisnews.com/article.pl?sid=04/02/02/1946240&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=67">Project Ocean: Stanford University And Google</a> where the two orgs are teaming up to digitize the entire collection of the Stanford Library published before 1923 (books that are now copyright-free).
<br />
<br />Google already has http://print.google.com that can search books for you.
