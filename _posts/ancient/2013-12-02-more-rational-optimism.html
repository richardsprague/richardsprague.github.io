<p>I can’t help being an optimist about technology and the future. Some of my&nbsp; favorite books are : <a title="The Rational Optimist- How Prosperity Evolves (P.S.)" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061452068/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0061452068&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=richasprag-20">The Rational Optimist- How Prosperity Evolves (P.S.)</a>. Or Ramez Naam’s <a title="The Infinite Resource- The Power of Ideas on a Finite Planet" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BUUITEI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BUUITEI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=richasprag-20">The Infinite Resource- The Power of Ideas on a Finite Planet</a>. So <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/29/everything-is-great-and-nobody-is-happy.aspx">this summary</a> from The Motley Fool is right up my alley. One excerpt:</p> <blockquote> <p>In two generations, the average American gained a decade of life expectancy. <p>Do you know what can happen in a decade? A little more than 10 years ago, AOL dominated the Internet, oil cost $13 a barrel, <em>Fortune</em> magazine named Enron one of America's "most admired corporations," and Apple was a joke. Everything can change, in other words. You get an extra one of those now.</p></blockquote> <p>I remember what life was like a decade ago, and I wouldn’t go back. I can’t wait for the next one.</p>
