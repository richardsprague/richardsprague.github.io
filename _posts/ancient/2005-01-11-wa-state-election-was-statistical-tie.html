Seattle Times quotes <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002147549_recount11m.html">several people</a> saying "this election was 99.9% accurate", including Democratic Party spokeswoman Lisa Cohen, King county Elections Superintendent Bill Huennekens.   But wait a minute!  With more than 2M votes cast, 99.9% isn't good enough: that's still a margin of error of over 2,000 votes.  With a 140-vote margin, the accuracy needs to be closer to 99.999% -- "5 nines", or roughly the standard used by the phone company.<br /><br />This election was a statistical tie.<br /><br />
