<p>Look at the cameras on top of this truck, spotted near the middle of Mercer Island yesterday.&nbsp; If you peer closely through the tinted glass, you can see several laptop computers with various map-like displays.</p> <p>The driver went systematically&nbsp;through every public street in our neighborhood, traveling at a pretty reasonable clip. I assume he was taking photos the whole time, which presumably means that in some future update of Windows Live Local, you'll see me holding a camera at the side of the road.</p> <p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2029/1500990922_173a623499.jpg?v=0"></p>
