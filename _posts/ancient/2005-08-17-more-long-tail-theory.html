<a href="http://secondlife.blogs.com/nwn/2005/08/the_long_tail_o.html#more">CSVEN CONCORD</a> has an interesting extension of <a href="http://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/">Chris Anderson's Long Tail </a>argument, how the Internet helps mine business among the vast masses of people underserved by normal commerce.
<br />
<br />Concord 3-dimensionalizes the idea to allow for fads, like Rocky Horror, that are popular but never really mainstream.
