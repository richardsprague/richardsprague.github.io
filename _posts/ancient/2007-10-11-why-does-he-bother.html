<p><a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/elections/pamphlet/pamphlet.aspx?cid=23425&amp;eid=1220#c7240">El Jahncke,</a> Mercer Island resident since 1978, is running uncontested for reelection to the City Council.&nbsp; He has <a href="http://www.pdc.wa.gov/">raised exactly $0</a> for his campaign.&nbsp; By all accounts, he is well-respected and well-liked.&nbsp; He will win no matter what he does.</p> <p>In spite of that, he goes out of his way to post signs (personally?),&nbsp;file <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/elections/pamphlet/pamphlet.aspx?cid=23425&amp;eid=1220#c7240">his biography in the official voters pamphlet</a>, and make himself available to the public, almost as if he's really running for reelection.&nbsp; Does he somehow think that we, the voting public, matter?</p> <p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2405/1545102204_0966d829e6.jpg?v=0"> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>But why does he bother?&nbsp;&nbsp;His fellow councilman,&nbsp;Steve Litzow, is also running uncontested and&nbsp;his biography doesn't even appear in the voters pamphlet.&nbsp; <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/08/out-of-staters-for-steve-litzow.html">Steve raised more than $20K</a> for this election, and spent more than half of it, mostly on consulting services.&nbsp;&nbsp; Steve sent a $3,000&nbsp;fund-raising letter in May -- how come I didn't get one?!&nbsp;&nbsp;-- but otherwise, in contrast to El Jahncke,&nbsp;I haven't seen any evidence whatsoever that he's campaigning.&nbsp; What do all his consultants ($3,000 -- billed long after it was clear he was running uncontested), web site designers ($500), book-keepers ($1000), and others do?&nbsp; </p> <p><em>Update:</em> shortly after this was posted, Steve Litzow signs started popping up all over.&nbsp; Today I even got my direct mail piece.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.stevelitzow.com/">His web site</a> is up and running and looking very slick.&nbsp; Go Steve!</p>
