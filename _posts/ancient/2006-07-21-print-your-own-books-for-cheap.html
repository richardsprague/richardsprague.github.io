The New York Times today has a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/20/technology/20basics.html?ei=5040&en=3a866bcb0065f87c&ex=1154145600&partner=MOREOVERNEWS&pagewanted=print">survey of the companies </a>that offer print-on-demand for books. <blockquote><p>When Steve Mandel, a management trainer from Santa Cruz, Calif., wants to show his friends why he stays up late to peer through a telescope, he pulls out a copy of his latest book, “Light in the Sky,” filled with pictures he has taken of distant nebulae, star clusters and galaxies.</p><p><br />“I consistently get a very big ‘Wow!’ The printing of my photos was spectacular — I did not really expect them to come out so well.” he said. “This is as good as any book in a bookstore.”</p><p><br />Mr. Mandel, 56, put his book together himself with free software from <a href="http://blurb.com/" target="_">Blurb.com</a>. The 119-page edition is printed on coated paper, bound with a linen fabric hard cover, and then wrapped with a dust jacket. Anyone who wants one can buy it for $37.95, and Blurb will make a copy just for that buyer.</blockquote><br /><br />Other companies that do this:<br /><a href="http://www.sharedink.com">sharedink.com</a>, which goes after high-end photographers ($39 for 20pp)<br /><a href="http://www.lulu.com">Lulu.com</a>, b/w novel-type books they'll sell through Amazon ($8 for 150pp)<br /><a href="http://www.picaboo.com">picaboo.com</a> says most of its customers are moms with kids<br /><br />I have previously used <a href="http://www.mypublisher.com">MyPublisher.com</a> to print a storybook for my daughter.  The prices on Lulu are low enough that it might be fun to print a collection of her stories and distribute them at her birthday party.
