A nice feature about one of the heroes of computer science, <a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2006/mayjun/features/knuth.html">Donald Knuth</a>, in this month's Stanford Magazine. When I was an undergrad, a friend introduced me to him as "the god of computers", but it wasn't until later that I realized how influential he was. He wrote Tex and Metafont, two early typesetting apps that got me interested in fonts.<br /><br />Two important facts about him that explain everything: he's from Wisconsin and he's a devout Lutheran. The article adds some more facts, like that he (still) writes several computer programs each week. I wonder what kind of computer he uses?<br /><br /><img src="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2006/mayjun/images/features/knuth_don.jpg" width="400" />
