<p>So much to write, so little time. Several good friends have asked me about what interesting books I've read lately. I say "check out my blog", but now I realize that I'm so far behind on my summaries that it'll be hard to get a good glimpse. So rather than do a helpful, thoughtful review, here's a brief look at where I'm getting my new ideas: <p><strong>Podcasts</strong> <p>I listen to an hour or so of various things each day. My favorite is <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/">Econtalk</a>, which comes out every Monday. Every one is good, but in the last few weeks I've particularly enjoyed the interview with <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2007/04/taleb_on_black.html">Black Swan author Nassim Taleb</a>. The basic idea is that many processes we think of as statistical (like stock markets or insurance) are really much more complicated. It'll be on my short list of books I want to read. <p>I also listen to the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/page/podcast.html?mod=topnav_0_0002">Wall Street Journal This Mornin</a>g, a daily business news summary, and I follow IT Conversations in case there's anything good. Nothing special lately, except for a <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3285.html">nice summary of open source telephony</a> that's relevant to what I do at work. <p><strong>Books</strong> <p>I'm <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sprague/archive/2007/09/26/steven-pinker-at-microsoft.aspx">reading Steven Pinker's new boo</a>k, of course, and I'll write up something in more detail when I'm done. I also read Tyler Cowen's <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2007/09/cowen_on_your_i.html#more">Discover Your Inner Economist</a>, but I found it disappointing: Cowen's <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com">Marginal Revolution</a> may be a nice blog, but in book form he just meanders too much. <p>There's much more to write, about movies (like the Enron Documentary I just watched) and tons of magazines. But I can't write now -- I have too much reading to finish.</p>
