<p>Maureen Judge did quite well in the August 21 primary election, <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/elections/200708/resPage7.htm">winning 1300 votes</a> -- 300 more than the next-highest candidate Mike Cero. No doubt part of her success is thanks to her fundraising.  <p>All candidates for public office, including local elections like City Council, must make their <a href="http://web.pdc.wa.gov/servlet/ContribServlet">donations public</a>. In her case, by mid-August&nbsp;she reported a total of about $15,000 (the highest among City Council candidates so far). Here's a breakdown&nbsp;of where the money comes from:</p> <p>&nbsp;<img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1202/1217843534_4c47f1adeb.jpg?v=0"> </p> <p>She&nbsp;enjoys about&nbsp;100 individual contributors so far, nearly all of them off-island.  <ul> <li>None of her top 10 contributors are from Mercer Island.  <li>The only Mercer Island contributors in the top 25 are Robert and Amanda Clark, who together donated $750. <li>Her largest individual contribution is the $1000 donated by Bothel Real estate agent Dan and Shauna Willner. <li>Of the top 50 contributors, here are the only ones from Mercer Island (each contributed $100): </li> <ul> <li>Pat and Dan Braman  <li>Judy Clibborn (state Representative)  <li>Mike Grady (City Councilman)  <li>Brian Weinstein (State Senator)</li></ul></ul> <p>Next: I'm working on a similar breakdown of the other candidates.&nbsp; Has anybody else already done this?&nbsp; Anybody want to help?</p> <p>[Full disclosure: I have not donated to any candidates]</p>
