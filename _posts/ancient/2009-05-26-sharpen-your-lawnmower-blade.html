<p>You’re supposed to do it once a season, but <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine-archive/may-2009/home-garden/hassle-free-lawns-and-yards/overview/hassle-free-lawns-and-yards-ov.htm" target="_blank">Consumer Reports says that 25%</a> of owners never sharpen their lawnmower blades. I’m happy to report that I no longer fit in that lazy category, and found to my delight that it was easier than I thought. </p>  <p>First step was to pin the blade down in such a way that it wouldn’t harm me while taking it off the mower.&#160; The directions say use a 2x4 board, but I didn’t have one handy, and I found that a brick works just fine.&#160; In my case, a quick counter-clockwise turn of the main bolt was enough to remove the blade safely.</p>  <p><a title="Sharpening a lawnmower blade." href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/3569627131/"><img alt="Sharpening a lawnmower blade." src="http://static.flickr.com/3644/3569627131_8661c4d0ed.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXLygHF6El4" target="_blank">How to sharpen the blade</a>: I suppose I could have found my own sharpener (I hear you can buy a small <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016P7H18?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=richasprag-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0016P7H18">$4 blade sharepner that works with any power drill</a><img style="margin: 0px; border-top-style: none! important; border-right-style: none! important; border-left-style: none! important; border-bottom-style: none! important" height="1" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=richasprag-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0016P7H18" width="1" border="0" /> for example) but that was too much hassle.&#160; People say that local plant nurseries, or hardware stores will sharpen the blade (for free?) but after some calls to Lowes and Home Depot, I came up with nothing.&#160; Eventually I discovered that our local equipment rental place (<a href="http://www.eastsiderental.com/" target="_blank">Eastside Rental</a>, in Bellevue) would do it while I wait.&#160; They charged an exorbitant $11, but it was worth it.</p>  <p>You should see how much better my lawn looks now!</p>
