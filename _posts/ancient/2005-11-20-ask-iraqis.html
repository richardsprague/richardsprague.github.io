<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10097801/from/RSS/">House spurns calls for immediate Iraq pullout - Conflict in Iraq - MSNBC.com</a>: "�It is the sense of the House of Representatives that the deployment of United States forces in Iraq be terminated immediately.�"
<br />
<br />I think the best idea is to have the Iraqis vote on this. The next election there should include this yes/no referendum: "The Iraqi people call for Coalition troops to leave Iraq within the next 90 days."  If a majority says yes, we should stick by their wishes.  Then our departure would be way more honorable than under any of the other scenarios being debated.
<br />
<br />But what if the Iraqis say no? Of course a lot of people would suspect the result was rigged, so the referendum should also include a promise to hold the same election again regularly.  But what would American politicians (particularly on the left) say if it were obvious that most Iraqis want us there?
