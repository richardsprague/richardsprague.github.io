<a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/babies-kids/child-car-booster-seats/car-seats-2-07/overview/0207_seats_ov.htm">ConsumerReports.org -</a> gained a lot of publicity early this month over their study concluding that car seats don't perform nearly as well as they should.<br /><br />Well, now <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB116914867393380554.html?mod=pj_main_hs_coll">they changed their mind</a>.  Turns out their tests were done improperly, at conditions more like 70 mph instead of 35mph.  So they're recalling the study until they can do a followup.<br /><br />Oh, never mind.
