It doesn't make much difference whether an airline asks people to board at random or by back-to-front seat number, according to <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/PS_cache/physics/pdf/0512/0512020.pdf">this paper </a>just published in Nature.
<br />
<br />A slightly better way would be to make window passengers board first.
