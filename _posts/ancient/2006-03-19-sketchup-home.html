Google just bought <a href="http://www.sketchup.com/">SketchUp</a>, a company that makes a simple CAD-like drawing program. It normally sells for $495 so I'll wait to see if Google decides to make a free version, like they did with Google Earth.<br /><br />My 6-year-old boy would love this software. We just watched the demo video and he was really salivating over the possibilities of drawing simple buildings and then watching them come to life inside the computer.<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://download.sketchup.com/graphics/markets/5architecture_image.jpg" />
