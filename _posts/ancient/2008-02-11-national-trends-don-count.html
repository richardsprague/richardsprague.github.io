<p>Read with a big grain of salt the Washington Post reprint on today's Seattle Times front page: <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2004176000_girls11.html">Girlhood Gone Wild: Drinking and Drug Use Grow</a>.&nbsp; It's riddled with errors and anecdotally-driven speculation, too many for me to refute right now.&nbsp; (e.g. the quote "a growing number of reports show that..." -- what does that even mean?)</p> <p>But my biggest criticism is the underlying assumption that a national story is relevant to you.&nbsp; It's too hard to keep track of what may or may not be happening at a national (or international) level, when what really matters --and where you have direct control -- is your own family and school.</p> <p>And what about my school?&nbsp; In fact, on Mercer Island we have the exact opposite problem. According to a <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/04/mercer-island-and-suniya-luthar.html">study by Columbia University psychologist Suniya Luthar</a>, half of all Mercer Island boys have tried marijuana by graduation time, but only 30% of girls have.&nbsp; And more significantly, it's the boys [who this article implies we can ignore] who appear to be driving the problems.</p> <p>I have no idea what's happening in Bethesda, Md (the source of quotes in the article).&nbsp; People in Bethesda should figure that out.</p>
