More reading of <a href="http://www.pfblog.com/">PFBlog</a> has me more impressed.<br /><br />It's an active account of how a normal guy is trying to pursue his financial goals, including his thoughts on ways to save money (this this review of <a href="http://www.pfblog.com/archives/840_vonage_much_improved_voip_technology_and_referral_deal.shtml">Vonage phone service</a>). The real interesting part, to me, is that he is apparently a Microsoft employee living in Sammamish. He posts his thoughts on changes to benefits programs, ESPP, etc.  It's just like talking to somebody in my hallway at work, only better because it's confidential: he doesn't reveal his actual identity (come to think of it, who knows, maybe he really is in my hallway).
