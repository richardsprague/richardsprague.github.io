from <a href="http://www.venturewire.com">VentureWire</a><br /><br />"Northern California continues to lead with the nation's highest paid start-ups CEOs, with median compensation hitting $275,000. Not far behind is the Northwest, where compensation jumped to $250,000 from $200,000. In the Northeast compensation dropped to $253,000 from $275,000 last year and the South saw a decline to $240,000 from $246,000. "<br /><br />Pretty good pay for running a company that doesn't earn a thing.
