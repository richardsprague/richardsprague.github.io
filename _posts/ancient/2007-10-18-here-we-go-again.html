<p>Argh, today's big storm caused the power to go out earlier this afternoon and now my neighborhood is in the dark again, <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2006/12/no-power-till-saturday.html">just like last December</a>, and I'm having to get on the Internet by candlelight. What a pain.</p> <p>About 100 homes on Mercer Island are without power, <a href="http://www.mercergov.org/News.asp?NewsID=1011">according to the city web site</a>,<strike> but I don't believe them -- it's got to be more than that. There's a whole dark section along West Mercer down to the water, and a friend says the South End is dark too.</strike></p> <p><em>Update</em>: I was wrong. The power to our neighborhood was back on before midnight and now everything's back to normal. Maybe it wasn't very widespread after all. Cancel that order for a generator.</p>
