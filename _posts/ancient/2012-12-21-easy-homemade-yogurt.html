<p>Among the many important aspects of health that science can’t yet explain is the <a href="http://commonfund.nih.gov/hmp/">role of microbes</a>, zillions of them in every part of your body, with far more varieties of DNA than you have in your own cells.</p> <p>Something so abundant and variable from person to person must have an important function, so for the past few months and thanks to <a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/fermented-food/">Seth Roberts</a> I’ve become interested in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1931498237/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=richasprag-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1931498237">fermented foods</a>. </p> <p>I considered buying <a title="Eurocuisine 2-Quart Yogurt Maker, YM260" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KBFO6C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=richasprag-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002KBFO6C">a yogurt maker</a>. At $50 and less, they’re not too expensive. But the last thing I need is more junk around the house, so finally last night I thought why not just make it myself using stuff we already have lying around. </p> <p>It was unbelievably easy!&nbsp; In fact, I’m not sure why I didn’t try this years ago.&nbsp; Here’s what I did:</p> <h2>Equipment</h2> <ul> <li>Ordinary 4-cup glass container with a rubber top.  <li>Heating pad and towel  <li>Saucepan for heating milk  <li>Any large bowl big enough to hold the glass container.  <li>Two cups of whole milk  <li>Half a tablespoon of plain yogurt. It’s important not to use too much. This is the “starter”, with live microbes.</li></ul> <h2>Recipe</h2> <ol> <li>Boil some water and use it to sterilize the glass container. (I bet this step is optional)  <li>Boil two cups of milk. Well, not quite boil, but heat it till it starts to get steamy.&nbsp; <li>Pour cold water into the large bowl. Leave it half-full in the sink.  <li>Pour the hot milk into the glass container and set the whole thing into the large bowl of water. (Don’t let water get into the milk)  <li>Stir the milk until the temperature is about 110 degrees. I use my trusty latte thermometer, but you could probably also just do it by feel. Wait till it’s warm – warmer than your body’s 98.6 degrees, but well short of feeling hot.  <li>Stir the yogurt into the milk and mix well.  <li>Cover the container and put it on top of the heating pad.  <li>Place the large bowl upside down on top of the container and heating pad.  <li>Set heating pad to “medium”  <li>Cover everything with a towel and leave it overnight.</li></ol> <p>Eight or so hours later, open it all up and find this:</p> <p><a title="Yogurt making" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/8295237838/"><img border="0" alt="Yogurt making" src="http://static.flickr.com/8501/8295237838_aa24757df6.jpg" width="466" height="353"></a></p> <p>I was surprised how thick it was, but the perfect, tangy smell was the giveaway: the best yogurt ever.</p>
