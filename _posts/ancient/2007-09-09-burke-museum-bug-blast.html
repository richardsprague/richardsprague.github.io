<p>The Burke Museum sponsored their annual <a href="http://www.washington.edu/burkemuseum/events/bugblast07/">Bug Blast</a> at the&nbsp;University of Washington today. <a href="http://ciscoe.com/">Ciscoe Morris</a>&nbsp;from KIRO 710 radio&nbsp;was there too, giving a talk about his experiences with local bugs.&nbsp; He's a local gardening expert and author.&nbsp; Hey, did you know he's originally from Wisconsin? <p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1326/1352740328_fbeb1d4e17.jpg?v=0">  <p>&nbsp;</p>Turns out there's a whole <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/06/sinodendron-rugosum.html">community of bug lovers</a> in the Seattle area, the <a href="http://crawford.tardigrade.net/">"Scarabs", a club founded in 1937</a> and open to the public. They're hosting a Bug Jam on Monday, September 24th at 7pm in the rear classroom at the Burke Museum and we can't wait.
