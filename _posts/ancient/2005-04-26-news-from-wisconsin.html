<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=703487">ABC News: Wis. Man Tells Police He Froze Dead Mother</a>: "LA CROSSE, Wis. Apr 25, 2005 ï¿½ A man told police he kept his mother's corpse in a basement freezer for more than four years while he collected her Social Security checks, authorities said Monday. A body was found encased in ice, in a sitting position. 
<br />Philip Schuth, 52, told police his elderly mother, Edith, died of natural causes in August 2000, but that he didn't tell anyone because he was afraid police would blame him, according to documents filed in court Monday. "
