<p>If you want to say something to Mercer Islanders, you can’t beat the intersection of Island Crest Way and 40th as a place to publicize your message.&#160; A large percentage of the island drives past it every morning, and they’re your captive audience until the light turns green.&#160; There must be an election or something this week, because here’s what we had this morning:</p>  <p><a title="IMG_7128" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2999215061/"><img alt="IMG_7128" src="http://static.flickr.com/3249/2999215061_42c29c34bb.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>Can you spot the three City Council members in these photos?</p>  <p><a title="IMG_7131" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2999209203/"><img alt="IMG_7131" src="http://static.flickr.com/3278/2999209203_d78eab8c26.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>I wonder how crowded it’ll be tomorrow morning?</p>
