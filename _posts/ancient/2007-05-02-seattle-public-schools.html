<p>A group of activists and parents has put together a fairly <a href="http://saveseattleschools.blogspot.com/">active blog to discuss Seattle Public Schools</a>.&nbsp; From their banner:</p> <blockquote> <p>Joining together across Seattle to fight for high quality public schools that educate all students to become passionate, lifelong learners.</p></blockquote> <p>Not necessarily directly relevant if you live on Mercer Island, but interesting reading, and points to the type of content that would make&nbsp;a good similar effort for Mercer Island.&nbsp; Anybody want to start one?&nbsp; I'll host!</p>
