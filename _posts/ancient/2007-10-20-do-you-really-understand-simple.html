<p>Iâ€™m a <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/04/simple-majority-for-school-levies.html">long-time supporter of EHJR 4204</a>, the <a href="http://vote.wa.gov/Elections/Measure2007.aspx?a=4204&amp;c=7">proposed change</a> to the Washington State Constitution to allow school levies to be approved by a simple majority (50%+1) rather than the super-majority (60%) required today . There is no shortage of <a href="http://milegislativeteam.wikispaces.com/Simple+Majority">well-written arguments</a> in favor of 4204, but they basically boil down to these two: <ol><li><strong>Schools are extremely important</strong> and they need more funding. <li><strong>The current constitutional system is archaic and unfair</strong>. The levy system was invented in the 1940s and a lot has changed since then. You can approve a jail with 50%, but not schools? A President or Governor can be elected by a mere 50% (or sometimes less), so it's ridiculous to put our children's future hostage to a higher bar.</li></ol><p>These arguments are pretty straight-forward, so why would anyone oppose the measure, especially when it's so vital to children? And why did it take half a century to finally propose ditching the current, unjust system? <p>The Voters Guide <a href="http://vote.wa.gov/Elections/Measure2007.aspx?a=4204&amp;c=7">official statement against 4204</a> just rants about high taxes, saying (I'm paraphrasing) even though we of course support education, you should reject this on the basic principle that higher taxes are never good. <p>Here are some much better arguments against the measure: <ul><li><strong>More than 98% of all levies pass anyway</strong>, so what's the problem? 33 out of 226 levies in 2006 passed the first time, and only 4 failed the second time (according to the <a href="http://www.simplemajority2007.org/levyresults.htm">pro-4204 campaign web site</a>). I'm not sure: has Mercer Island, for example, ever failed to get levy funds? <li><strong>Levies often fail for good reasons.</strong> Who decides how much to raise in a levy, and how to spend it? School board elections everywhere are notoriously uncompetitive. Mercer Island's currently open seats are all uncontested.  If the public's not watching, a tiny minority can put whatever they like on that levy and that 60% approval is often the only thing holding them back. For example: <ul><li>Bainbridge Island tried to use their levy to pay for a laptop for each child in the district (according to a caller on last <a href="http://www.kuow.org/defaultProgram.asp?ID=13658">Wednesday's KUOW Community Forum</a> podcast). Many voters thought it was a wasteful use of tax-payer money, particularly in an affluent community where parents could afford this with their own money. <li>Name something controversial in your community: Intelligent Design textbooks? Immigration? PEAK? What stops the levy committee from putting their pet project into your taxes? Answer: the fear of igniting an organized backlash that threatens that 60% majority.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Renters benefit from schools too</strong>, and they should pay their fair share. Why force property owners to bear the burden of schools alone, particularly in a community with a large percentage of home-owning seniors living on fixed incomes? <li><strong>Schools don't fail for lack of money.</strong> Corrected for inflation, <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d04/tables/dt04_163.asp">spending per student has tripled since 1960</a>. Forcing levy backers to get 60% approval also forces them to get real community sponsorship of the schools -- which is often at least as important as the money itself.</li></ul><p>As I said, I'm a big supporter of 4204, and I want you to support it as well. But you can't be a good advocate without understanding and refuting the counter-arguments. Can you ?</p>
