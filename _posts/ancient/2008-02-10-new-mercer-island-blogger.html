<p>Please welcome to your blogroll the new <a href="http://mercerislandblogger.wordpress.com/">Surrounded By Water: A Mercer Island Blog</a>. I don't know the author,&nbsp; but I can't wait to learn more about him (her?).&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a couple who have just arrived to the island and are writing about their first impressions:</p> <blockquote> <p>I imagined a place full of Stepford Wives, which was difficult because I havenâ€™t read the book or seen the movie. Anyway, we wondered if we would be shunned by our neighbors. Or worse, we would be welcome but, over time, become horrible people ourselves.</p></blockquote> <p>Did you say <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2006/09/stepford-wives-ii.html">Stepford Wives</a> ?&nbsp; I guess our secret is beginning to leak?</p> <p>Anyway, please go to her comments section and leave a <strike>snobby </strike>warm Mercer Island welcome to our new neighbor!</p>
