<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/02/11/228249&amp;from=rss">Slashdot | Microsoft: The Faint Smell of Rot</a> points to an article by MICHAEL S. MALONE printed here that claims Microsoft is on the way out.
<br />
<br />This is not a new argument: Wired and many others have talked about this for years, and someday no doubt it will be true. Microsoft's biggest enemy is the Law of Large Numbers: once you reach this level of market dominance, you can't grow faster than the world economy.
<br />
<br />Still, it is clearly a different place than it used to be. People don't work nearly as hard, and you can tell in lots of little areas that the place is taking too many things for granted.
