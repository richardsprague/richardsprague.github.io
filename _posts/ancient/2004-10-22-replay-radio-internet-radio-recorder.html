After knowing about it for months, I finally bought a copy of <a href="http://www.replay-radio.com/">Replay Radio</a>, basically a Tivo for Internet radio streams.  It comes with a huge database of all the times/URLs for any radio program you'd want to record (from NRP to Rush Limbaugh).  
<br />
<br />I programmed it this morning to record Morning Edition for my commute to the office, and I have to say it was amazing. I was able to listen to a full hour of NPR in less than 15 minutes through a combination of skipping segments and using the double-speed playback option.  Talk about efficient!
