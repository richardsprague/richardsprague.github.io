<p>We just got back from a fun ski trip and around 6pm I got a knock on the door from a stranger who introduced himself as "Jimmie".&nbsp; Very polite, very nice guy, said he was from <a href="http://www.usmission.org">United States Mission</a>, a homeless shelter in Seattle.&nbsp; He asked if I'd be willing to donate.&nbsp; I don't know anything about the organization, but I took his flyer and said I'd read it later.</p> <p>We rarely get unsolicited callers during the evening (except maybe during campaign season).&nbsp; Upon reading their web site I see that the people who receive services from them are put to work six days a week doing a variety of things, including fundraising.&nbsp; Maybe that's what Jimmie was up to.</p>
