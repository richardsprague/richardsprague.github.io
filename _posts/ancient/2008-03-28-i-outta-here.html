<p>I'll be offline for the next week without internet access somewhere in the jungles of Costa Rica.&nbsp; See you when I get back.</p> <p><font size="1">(For those of you who think it's dangerous to say this on the Wide Open Internet where any whacko can read this, please note that yes, my home security system is turned on and yes, the neighbors are watching.&nbsp; Oh, and now that a zillion of my blog-reading friends know this too, any Bad Guy who wants to try something nefarious while I'm out is going to find he is very outnumbered)</font></p>
