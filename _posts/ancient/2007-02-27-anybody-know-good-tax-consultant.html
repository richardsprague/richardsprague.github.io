<p>My taxes aren't <em>super </em>complicated -- it's not like I've got second homes and rental property all over the place -- but I'm not a 1040EZ case either.&nbsp; Last year I filed using TurboTax Online, and it worked great except for, um, a slight boo-boo that could have been prevented if somebody who knows tax law was looking over my shoulder.&nbsp; In past years, like when we moved from California and bought a new house, I've paid professionals, but I haven't been happy with the tax consultants we've found in the Bellevue or Mercer Island area.&nbsp; I have all my records in order, so it should be an easy job for somebody who knows what they're doing.&nbsp;I just want quality, and somebody who can explain to me what they're doing.</p> <p><a href="http://www.judysbook.com/cities/mercerisland/BtoB~Professional-Services/23509087/p1/Harley_H_Hoppe_and_Associates.htm">Judysbook.com</a> has a recommendation somebody posted for <a href="http://www.harleyhoppe.com/">Harley H Hoppe &amp; Associates</a>, but it looks like a property tax specialist who would probably be overkill for me.&nbsp; </p> <p>Who do <em>you</em> use for <em>your</em> taxes?</p>
