<p>Great one-hour <a href="http://fora.tv/2010/07/08/Sir_Ken_Robinson_The_Element#Ken_Robinson_Public_Education_a_Relic_of_Industrial_Age">video/podcast by Ken Robinso</a>n, public education expert.</p><p>I liked this part (about 43 minutes in) when he relates a conversation he once had with a musician:</p><p><strong>Ken:</strong> "I'd love to do what you do."</p><p><strong>Musician: </strong>"No you wouldn't."</p><p><strong>Ken:</strong> "What do you mean?  Of course I would."</p><p><strong>Musician</strong>: "I practice six hours a day and play five times a week. I've been doing this since I was a small boy. I do it because I love it. You like the <em>idea</em> of doing it.</p><p>If you loved it, you'd be doing it."</p><p><a href="http://fora.tv/2010/07/08/Sir_Ken_Robinson_The_Element#Ken_Robinson_Public_Education_a_Relic_of_Industrial_Age"><img title="kenrobinson.png" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_sDbqdqESbOw/TVivyb-E57I/AAAAAAAByR0/B1fEEgBZaqI/kenrobinson.png?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="Ken Robinson" width="400" height="224" /></a></p><p>Many more great ideas in there about why today's entire education system is misguided and needs to be transformed, not simply reformed.  It's a video, but no slides or anything, so go ahead and listen to it on your commute like I did.</p><p>Note: you have to buy a $5/month subscription to Fora.TV to download from the site, but you can get the MP4 file for free if you <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/fora-tv/id267709234">subscribe on iTunes</a>.</p>
