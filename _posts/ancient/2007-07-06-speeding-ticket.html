<ol> <p><img height="277" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1174/738169025_cc57885c7e.jpg?v=0" width="369"></p> <p>&nbsp;After how many decades of perfect driving (not one scratch, not one ticket), I was stopped last week by officer M684 on motorcycle at Milepost 202 on I-5 North, just North of Marysville. He claims I was going 65 in a 60mph zone and ticketed me for a <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.61.400">46.61.400</a> ("Basic Rule and Maximum Limits"). He wrote me up for $81. </p> <p>As I study this thing more closely I learn the following about Washington driving laws:  <li>There is no such thing here as "traffic school", that silly waste of time that people in California refer to as "kindergarten for adults".  <li>Since I have an excellent driving record, I can take a "deferment" if the judge allows. Basically, this means I pay the fine and if I don't commit any other violations for a year, it gets wiped off my record. I'm only allowed one deferment every seven years.  <li>Speeding tickets remain on your record for three years.  <li><a href="http://www.speedingticketcentral.com/Washington-State-speeding-ticket.html">SpeedingTicketCentral</a> recommends against a contested hearing. The ticket itself is considered evidence you committed the infraction. The officer doesn't have to appear in court, and it's simply the word of a trained officer against yours.  <h4>Possible attorneys who can represent me</h4> <p><a href="http://www.tixnix.com/index.cfm">TixNix</a> is a site that claims to put me in touch with an attorney specializing in traffic violations. <a href="http://www.seattletrafficlawyer.com/">Donaldson &amp; Knigge</a> is one such firm that for $265 will handle all the paperwork, and even appear in court for you. Another firm, Jahnis J. <a href="http://www.trafficticketdefensewa.com/">Abelite</a>, based in Arlington (where my officer is based) and on their web site claims they won 110/115 cases. Another is <a href="http://waticket.com/index.html">Waticket</a>, though their website makes them sound more pushy than I like.  <p>The whole episode caught me off-guard and I'm now kicking myself for not paying more attention, not so much to the speed I was traveling (believe me, I wasn't doing anything unsafe) but to my reaction when I saw the policeman.  <h4>Here are some things I wish I had done:</h4> <li>Take lots of photos. My video camera was right there on the seat next to me: why oh why didn't I just pick it up and record the whole thing? IF nothing else it would have been a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTxWoXDXht4">great Youtube video</a>.  <li>Engage in conversation. I had so many questions, but I just wasn't thinking enough to ask. What was his evidence? What is the speed limit here and how far up the road does it last?  <p>How about you? Any advice?</p></li></ol>
