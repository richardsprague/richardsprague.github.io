The <a href="http://www.investors.com/default.asp?src=">Investor's Business Daily</a> web site is free from Jan 9 - 15th.<br /><br />When I worked at Apple years ago, I told myself to sell all my employee stock purchase shares as soon as they arrived and invest them in my arch-competitor.  Working now at MSFT, I'm looking for similar alternatives to simply parking those shares in my own company's stock.
