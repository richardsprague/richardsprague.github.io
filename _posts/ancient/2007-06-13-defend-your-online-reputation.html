<p>When your name is Googled, do people get an accurate picture? or is there some pesky item in your past that you'd like to see go away?&nbsp; The WSJ has a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118169502070033315.html?mod=djemTECH">nice overview of ReputationDefenders</a>, a small company devoted to helping clients undo negative Internet postings.&nbsp; Starting at $10/month and about $30/post you want eliminated, they'll help you clean up your online reputation.</p> <blockquote> <p>Chris Dellarocas, a University of Maryland associate professor who studies how reputations are built online, said the services are fighting a growing trend of sites that let users recommend, rank and opine on other people, from RateMyProfessor to Rapleaf, a site for people to rate each other after business transactions.</p></blockquote> <p>Rather than fight negative postings, I think it's far more effective to get positive postings added to your online reputation.&nbsp; Controlling what the internet says about you is far more effective, I think, than reacting later when other people post something you dont' like.&nbsp; Another service, DefendMyName, claims that for $1K/month they'll do that.</p>
