<p>The Seattle Times <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/editorialsopinion/2003966156_mied22.html">endorsed somebody named</a>&nbsp;Kathleen for Mercer Island city council.&nbsp; Anybody know who he/she is?&nbsp; I'm sure that these editorial boards have a thorough vetting of each candidate before doing their endorsements, which is of course why I trust every single word of their editorials.&nbsp; So who's Kathleen?&nbsp; Are the other names right too?</p>
