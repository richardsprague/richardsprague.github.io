<p>The future of news is an important piece of the future of technology, so this <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/05/the-leaked-new-york-times-innovation-report-is-one-of-the-key-documents-of-this-media-age/">leaked writeup from Nieman Labs</a> on an innovation post-mortem from the New York Times caught my attention. Among the observations:</p><ul><li>The homepage is irrelevant: only a third of readers ever visit it. But the concept of “top news stories” still drives too much of what the org does.</li><li>Technology, in the form of better structuring and mining of existing data or repurposing content in interactive ways, can drive engagement as much or more than great stories.</li><li>The newsroom (manufacturing) and marketing (sales) can no longer be separate. If anything, the future is making business/sales less and less of a standalone entity.</li></ul><p>One thing I’ve always wondered is why people care so much about <em>new</em> content. Let’s face it: most of the best content was produced long, long ago. Much, perhaps most great content (e.g. recipes, travel, historical events) ages well and often I’d rather read a great past story than a mediocre one from today.</p><p>This whole article is worth reading.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
