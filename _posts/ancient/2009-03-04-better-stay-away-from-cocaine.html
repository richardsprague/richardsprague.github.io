<p>A <a href="http://spittoon.23andme.com/2009/03/03/snpwatch-unlikely-gene-may-contribute-to-cocaine-dependence-and-paranoia/trackback/" target="_blank">new study reported</a> on the 23andme blog shows a link between cocaine-induced paranoia and the SNP rs9387522.&#160; Turns out that I have the TT variation of this gene, which correlates with increased odds of cocaine-induced paranoia.</p>  <p>Guess I better stay away from cocaine.</p>  <p>I find this to be a problem with many (most?) of the conclusions I get from <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/10/whats-in-my-genes-results-from-23andme.html" target="_blank">my 23andme results</a>.&#160; So far most of the actionable consequences of my genes tell me to avoid behavior that my mother taught me long ago was bad anyway.&#160; Although I’m glad I took the test, and I eagerly look for a reason to recommend the test to others, so far I haven’t found many examples of why I think you should pay $300 to see your results.</p>
