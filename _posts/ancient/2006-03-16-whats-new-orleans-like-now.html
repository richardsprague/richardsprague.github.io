My sister-in-law, who has lived there all her life sent me this like to answer the question of what's it really like there now? What you see on the news is often preselected for shock value -- after all, why broadcast images of a mundane street scene when you can show miles of flood-damaged houses, or people who look ready to riot? <a href="http://www.cleanno.org/">CleanNO.org</a> is a smaller site, made by "normal" people in New Orleans: middle class family people with jobs, church-going and very, very boring. I'm not sure, but there may even be some Republicans in there. These are the people who don't think George Bush, Michael Brown, Bill Clinton, Michael Moore, had anything to do with Katrina one way or another -- and they aren't expecting help from any of those people either because they believe they have to do it all themselves.<br /><br />The answer is it's very tragic: all these normal people, who lost everything and have nothing to do but work one day at a time at rebuilding.
