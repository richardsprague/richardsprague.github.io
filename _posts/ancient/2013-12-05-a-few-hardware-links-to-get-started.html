<p>I've been playing with hardware now for a year or so and this may be a good time to summarize some of the interesting products I've found. I confess that most of the real product-making has been done by my colleagues in Beijing, but I try to stay on top of it by playing as much as I can, and here are some things I've learned. <p>First, for sources of good up-to-date information, it's hard to beat the <a href="http://www.hackthings.com/">hackthings blog</a>. Most every day, they feature an interesting new product or idea, often with background of how it was (or will be) manufactured or sold. Whether you're a hobbyist or a potential startup, you'll also appreciate the lengthy list of hardware resources/tools on <a href="http://steveblank.com/tools-and-blogs-for-entrepreneurs/#startup-tools">Steve Blank's entrepreneur site</a>. <p>If you're going to teach yourself hardware, Arduino is a great place to start (<a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2012/12/my-first-arduino-project-temperature.html">as I did</a>), but you can quickly burn through a lot of parts. Instead, use an Arduino software simulator like the one from <a href="http://123d.circuits.io/">123d.circuits.io</a>.&nbsp; For a similar browser-based simulator for non-Arduino purposes, try <a href="https://www.circuitlab.com/">https://www.circuitlab.com/</a>.&nbsp; <p>If you're building self-tracking body hardware, you might check out the $500 <a href="http://www.cooking-hacks.com/ehealth-sensors-complete-kit-biometric-medical-arduino-raspberry-pi">E-Health Sensor Shield Kit</a>&nbsp; for Arduino and Raspberry Pi. It comes with ten body sensors, including pulse/oxygen (SPO2), body temperature, glucometer, galvanic skin response, EMG, ECG and more. For instructions on how to just make it all from scratch, see this<a href="http://erkutlu.blogspot.com/2012/12/eeg-and-arduino-do-it-yourself-eeg-ekg.html"> DIY EEG/EKG/EMG site</a>. <p>Low-power devices connected to your smartphone will use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and people have suggested I check out the $35 <a href="http://redbearlab.com/blemini/">BLE Mini from Redbear Labs</a>, the $100 <a href="http://www.mouser.com/nordicsemiconductor/">nRF8001 Development Kit</a>&nbsp; from Nordic Semiconductor, or the $30 <a href="https://launch.punchthrough.com/">LightBlue Cortado</a> (shipping in mid-2014). <p>I have a ton more links in a private Evernote folder, as well as on my public <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:sprague">Pinboard</a> account. As always, ping me if you have other suggestions. <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Harald_Blaatand.jpg">
