<a href="http://blogs.onenw.org/gideon/archives/001828.html">Gideon Rosenblatt's Blog</a> suggested looking at <a href="http://www.eliyon.com/PublicSite/public/default.asp">eliyon: BusinessPeople search</a>, and indeed it is pretty incredible the kind of information they have about people.  It's a search site boasting something like 24 Million biographies of people, all supposedly culled from public Internet records.
<br />
<br />It seems to know almost nothing about <a href="http://networking3.eliyon.com/PeopleFinder/PersonDetail.asp?PersonID=666852389">me</a>, although it finds references to 55 people named "Richard Sprague".  That's a relatively common name, which is part of the explanation of course.  I'm not sure whether to feel more safe (they don't know about me) or disappointed (they don't know about me).
