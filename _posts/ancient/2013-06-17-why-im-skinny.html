<p>I weigh about the same today as I did in college: 160 pounds. In my entire life I’ve never weighed more than 170. Maintaining my weight has been effortless: I eat pretty much whatever I like, whenever I want, and in whatever quantity suits me at the time.&nbsp; I know, I know, this is not normal and I should be thankful.&nbsp; The vast majority of people, especially past middle age, seem like they have to starve themselves to keep from piling on the pounds.</p> <p>Why?&nbsp; I’m not particularly athletic. Although I don’t think of myself as sedentary <em>per se</em>, I’m hardly the type who does regular biking or jogging. </p> <p>It might be genetic, but it’s hard to say.&nbsp; <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/10/whats-in-my-genes-results-from-23andme.html">My 23andme results</a> suggest, if anything, I have the opposite problem (<a href="https://www.23andme.com/you/journal/obesity/overview/">72/100 vs 64/100</a> for people like me).&nbsp; On the other hand, I have the GG marker for <a href="https://www.23andme.com/you/explorer/snp/?snp_name=rs925946">rs925946</a>, which puts me at lower odds, but who knows.&nbsp; Most of my relatives are on the thin side, but we have our share of porkers too. I doubt my DNA explains everything.</p> <p>One of my favorite theories is that I’m host to a <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2013/05/book-epidemic-of-absence.html">benevolent microbiome</a>, a colony of bacteria in my digestive system that processes food as I eat it, to prevent me from becoming either too skinny or too fat. But I’ve been <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2011/10/what-happened-to-me.html">hospitalized</a> with some powerful antibiotics that probably killed off whatever beneficial bacteria I have, so that’s not persuasive either.</p> <p>That leaves the most obvious possibility – that I just don’t eat enough – but I’ve never proven that objectively. Until now.</p> <p>For the past week I’ve been wearing the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052KONSI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0052KONSI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=richasprag-20">BodyMedia Fit</a>, a $90 simple and non-obtrusive armband that’s so light it’s easy to forget I have it on. Using four <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2011/02/coming-wave-of-sensors.html">hi-tech sensors</a>, it calculates my metabolism with <a href="http://www.bodymedia.com/Professionals/Health-Professionals">92% accuracy</a> compared to the Gold Standard lab equipment. To track my food intake, I use <a href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com/">MyFitnessPal</a>, a (free) iPhone app with a huge database of food types (and super-handy UPC code scanner) that makes it easy to enter what I ate each day. </p> <p> Here are the results:</p> <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-9BaGx34dN_Y/Ub-gTilpe4I/AAAAAAACt1Q/eT4zZgUv9Ok/s1600-h/image%25255B4%25255D.png"><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-uBejdF34n8o/Ub-gU_bzqnI/AAAAAAACt1Y/sSeun9fdjF0/image_thumb%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="475" height="265"></a></p> <p><strong>The bottom line is that I’m thin because I don’t overeat</strong>. Apparently my metabolism is set to burn off whatever comes in, which turns out to be well within the range of what it takes to stay thin.</p> <p>I’m not a weight loss expert, and this is not a testimonial for how to lose weight. Everyone is different, and my results probably won’t help you. But if you want to understand what your body is doing – the first step toward making any changes – then I highly recommend getting a device like this one to understand your metabolism objectively.</p> <p>Incidentally, a good follow-up question is why I don’t feel <em>hungry</em>. I don’t think weight issues can be solved with self-control: diets fail in the long run if they depend on willpower. <a href="http://sethroberts.net/">Seth Roberts always has thoughts</a> about this that intrigue me and I’ll spend more time thinking about that in the future.</p> <p>[Placeholder: I’m writing up many more details, including the raw data, about my week with BodyMedia and I’ll post a link here when I’m finished]</p>
