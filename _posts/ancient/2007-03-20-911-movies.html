The director&nbsp;is so good focusing&nbsp;on what might otherwise be mundane -- filling the planes with fuel, chit-chat among flight attendents talking about plans for next weekend, an elderly woman taking pills before takeoff.&nbsp; It just left me feeling sick, during and afterwards -- sick with rage, of course, but also just a hopeless sense of frustration.</p> <p>WTC on the other hand was much easier to watch.&nbsp; It doesn't feel at all like an Oliver Stone movie -- no conspiracies, no dark and evil personalities -- just normal people caught up in an extraordinary circumstance and glad in the end to be alive.</p>
