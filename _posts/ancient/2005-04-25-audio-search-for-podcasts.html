<a href="http://www.podscope.com/search.php?q=recognition">Podscope</a> is a new search engine (beta), apparently built in cooperation with TVEyes, that does an audio search through podcasts.  You type your search query and it tells you all the audio files that it thinks contains that text.  Very cool.
