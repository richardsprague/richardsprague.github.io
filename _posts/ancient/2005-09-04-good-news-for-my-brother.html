Good news: we were able to make contact with somebody from my brother's neighborhood in Kenner who stayed behind. He'll check out Gary's house (on Champaign Drive just north of the Esplanade Mall) today, but says that most of the other houses in that area are just fine: no structural or flood damage.<br /><br />Here's a satellite image taken a few days ago and available on <a href="http://earth.google.com/katrina.html">Google Earth</a>. I couldn't get an image of Gary's house exactly, but this is only a few blocks south.<p><br /><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/8/1617/400/garysneighborhood.jpg" title="" border="0"><br /><p><br />I don't see any obvious problems, in contrast to the awful destruction in similar images around downtown New Orleans.<br /><br />Thanks to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sprague/archive/2005/09/02/460375.aspx#comments">several people</a> who helped find more information.<br /><br />By the way, this is a good time for those who are safe to be extremely thankful, and for all of us to be extra sensitive and generous to the hundreds of thousands who have been devasted. A lot of us are offended by the brutal, insensitive comments of film-maker Michael Moore, for example (I won't link to it), or from anyone on the right or left who tries to make this into a political issue. <br />
