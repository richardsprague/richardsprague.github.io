<p>A big treat today: while visiting Seattle I stopped by the world headquarters of the <a href="http://cloverequipment.com/home/default.aspx">Coffee Equipment Company</a> where Zander Nosler gave me a personal tour of their factory and explained the history of the company. What a place!&nbsp; The machines are hand-assembled by&nbsp; the engineering team that designs the product.&nbsp; These people definitely know how to build hardware, and it shows in the flavor you get from the coffee. Besides Trabant (<a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/11/clover-coffee.html">which I visited last month</a>), Clover machines are also in use at Zoka and a few others places in Seattle.&nbsp; So much excellent coffee, so little time!</p> <p><a title="IMG_3335" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2124238054/"><img alt="IMG_3335" src="http://static.flickr.com/2243/2124238054_18c3d5947a.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
