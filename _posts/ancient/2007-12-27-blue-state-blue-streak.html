<p>When I'm online, whether sending emails or posting content, I know that my kids may be reading, so just as in real life I think it's important to be civil. That's why for example, I don't use foul language either offline or online. <p>So why is it that most, if not all <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/">left-leaning blogs</a> seem to overflow with the kinds of words that would have my mother reaching for the soap dish? Right-wing blogs, by contrast, rarely if ever use profanity. <p>Even the name of my favorite<a href="http://www.horsesass.org/"> local liberal blog</a> is not a word I'd want to hear coming from my five-year-old. And the progressive bloggers' obsession with potty talk is not just something I'm imagining. Somebody did an unscientific study of that shows <a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2007/03/seven-words-you-can-never-say-on.html">filthy language is 41 times more common</a> on liberal blogs than on conservative ones. <p>I've been <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sprague/archive/2007/09/26/steven-pinker-at-microsoft.aspx">reading Steven Pinker's latest book</a>, The Stuff of Thought, where he explains how naughty words are a window into emotion, which of course explains why angry liberals are profane, but why don't conservatives dish it back?</p>
