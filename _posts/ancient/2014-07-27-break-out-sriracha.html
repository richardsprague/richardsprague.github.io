Seth Roberts often came up with hunches, reasonable hypotheses, about various foods or habits. But don’t pick the hypotheses randomly; base it on something, make sure it fits a bigger theory about the world, and then devise experiments to prove the hunch wrong. &nbsp;My hunch is that hot, spicy foods are good for you and that adding even a small amount to any food helps make it more nutritious. &nbsp;Here’s the new one I’m going to try: sriracha sauce.<br />My reasons:<br /><ul><li>Highest rating by <a href="http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/p/33599978/Cooks-Illustrated-Rates-Hot-Sauces--Disses-Tabasco.aspx">Cooks Illustrated</a>.
