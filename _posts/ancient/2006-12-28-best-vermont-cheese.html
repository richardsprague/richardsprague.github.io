<p>When we visited Vermont last summer, I made a note to remember the excellent "Constant Bliss" cow milk cheese, made by <a href="http://www.jasperhillfarm.com/ourcheese.html">Jasper Hill Farms.</a>&nbsp; Also check their Bayley Hazen blue cheese.</p> <p>They're sold at Zingerman's, in Ann Arbor and at two places in Portland, Oregon, but apparently not in Washington state.</p> <p><img src="http://www.jasperhillfarm.com/images/top_08.jpg"></p>
