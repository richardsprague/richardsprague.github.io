<p><img src="http://zhao.educ.msu.edu/images/yong.jpg"></p> <p> The Mercer Island education community is talking about <a href="http://zhao.educ.msu.edu/default.asp">Yong Zhao</a>, a professor at Michigan State University with ideas on how to improve schools global competitiveness.</p> <p>He'll be<a href="http://www.misd.k12.wa.us/news/frontpage/Y_Zhao_Bio.pdf"> doing a presentation</a>, open to the public, at <a href="http://zhao.educ.msu.edu/default.asp">Mercer Island High School on May 13th</a> at 7pm, so somebody sent me a link to <a href="http://videoweb.nie.edu.sg/vod/NIE%20Events%202005/International%20Conference%20on%20Education/An%20Ecological%20Analysis%20of%20Technology%20Diffusion%20in%20Schools%20and%20its%20Implications/Broadband/An%20Ecological%20Analysis%20of%20Technology%20Diffusion%20in%20Schools%20and%20its%20Implications.asx">video of a talk</a> he did in Singapore a few years ago.&nbsp; You can skip the 60min lecture and <a href="http://www.schoolsnetwork.org.uk/uploads/documents/11%20The%20Social%20Life%20of%20Technology%20(NXPowerLite)_124769.ppt">just skim the powerpoint</a> to get the basic idea. <p>Or if you want to hear the conclusion, skip ahead to about the 40:00 part of the talk (see slide 37).&nbsp; Here's the gist: <ul> <li>Why are computers not making an impact on classrooms? <ul> <li>It’s not the teachers: they’ve all been trained <li>There’s no shortage of great software</li></ul></li></ul> <ul> <li>Think of classrooms as ecosystems made of computers, students, teachers, etc. evolving toward an equilibrium <li>“Innovation is like an invasive species” that can only succeed by displacing something else <ul> <li>E.g. IM chatting (which should be an innovation) is thought of as a distraction to be shut down instead of a great way to enhance  <li>PDAs are wasted because teachers don’t bother understanding them well enough to integrate into the ecology. <li>“computers only help if used less than 3 hrs/day” -- after that it’s wasted. <li>Henry Ford thought cars would be great because they’ll eliminate congestion caused by horses. How wrong!</li></ul></li></ul> <p>Summary of suggestions (starts at minute 50:00) <ul> <li>Need a <em>network</em> of teachers working together, not as individuals <li>Technology takes time to soak in <li>Encourage teachers to play with technology instead of teaching it <li>Connect to existing practices and beliefs <li>Find the right niche where technology is natural, not forced</li></ul> <p>My takeaway: everything depends on the teacher, staff, and community. If you have proactive, intelligent, innovative teachers, your technology will help a lot. If people are just using technology because somebody told them to do it, it won’t work. <p>Note that this is no different than the situation in industry.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/02/19/apples_jobs_blasts_teachers_unions.html">World-class companies</a> require world-class employees and so do schools.&nbsp; I still think the best place to start is the McKinsey study <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/12/how-to-improve-schools.html">I mentioned before</a>.&nbsp; </p>
