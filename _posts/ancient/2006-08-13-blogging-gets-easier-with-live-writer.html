<p>The Windows Live team has just released the best blogging tool ever: <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D85741BB5E0BE8AA!174.entry">Live Writer</a>.&nbsp; I've been using it for a few weeks now and it really has made it so much easier to write blogs. So far I have it working effortlessly with my <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sprague">Work blog</a> (this one), my <a href="http://richardsprague.blogspot.com/">personal one</a>&nbsp;(with Blogger--which I've been using long before they it became Google) and one <a href="http://sprague.wordpress.com/">I keep at WordPress</a> (which, once I've had more time to work on it might become my main one).</p> <p>I like blogging for several reasons, but the main one is that it makes it easier for me to keep track of what my friends find interesting. I follow hundreds of RSS feeds, scanning them regularly for updates, which is relatively easy these days because most people only post once a week or so.&nbsp;Hopefully that will change when they see how super-easy it is to post with Live Writer.</p>
