<p>I’ve been blogging regularly for close to five years now, but I still can’t seem to get my Mom to read me.&#160; When I talked with her (and Dad) this morning, they still hadn’t heard about some of the things my blog readers take for granted, like the <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/11/fooled-by-randomness-book.html" target="_blank">Randomness</a> book I read last week or the the lower <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/11/cheap-gas.html" target="_blank">price of gas</a> here.</p>  <p>So, maybe I can get my parents to take advantage of the new “Subscribe via email” option I added to the right hand column of this page.&#160; Enter your email address there and you no longer have to load this page into your browser in order to read my latest drivel.&#160;&#160; Don’t worry, your email address is stored securely and won’t be given over to a spammer.&#160; </p>  <p>Oh, and if you haven’t noticed already, you’re welcome to follow me on Twitter too.&#160; That’s a more efficient way to track the basics of a person: keep up to date on where I am and what I’m doing.&#160; Just go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/sprague">http://www.twitter.com/sprague</a> and set up your (quick) account.</p>  <p>Welcome to my life, Mom!</p>
