<p></p> <p>An upcoming paper in the Journal of Financial Economics studied business plans from the dot-com era and concluded that the "bubble" wasn't much different from what happens at the birth of any new industry.&nbsp; David A. Kirsch from the University of Maryland (see<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB116294042194116133.html?mod=hps_us_editors_picks"> WSJ.com</a>) says: <ul> <li>the&nbsp;failure rate of dot-coms was only about 20% per year</li> <li>spectacular blow-outs (like pets.com or webvan) resulted from the "get big fast" strategy that many pursued in order to gain their first-mover advantage.</li> <li>many success stories happened in smaller niches that are just fine as businesses, though not as well-known&nbsp;as the big names.</li></ul> <p>This reminds me of the advice in entrepreneurship classes, how it's a myth that "the vast majority of new businesses fail".&nbsp; In fact, the majority of dumb businesses fail, but well-thought ideas that focus on good, flexible business plans with good execution do just fine.</p>
