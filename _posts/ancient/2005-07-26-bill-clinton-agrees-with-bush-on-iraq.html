Speaking at the <a href="http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/columns/imperialcity/12266/index.html">Aspen Institute's Ideas Festival</a> Bill Clinton says: "'This is not Vietnam. I wouldnï¿½t set a deadline [for the withdrawal of troops]. I agree with the president.'"
<br />
<br />[from <a href="http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news">New York Metro</a>], which adds: <em>If anyone but him had said the same thing about Iraq, there would have been boos and hisses.</em>
