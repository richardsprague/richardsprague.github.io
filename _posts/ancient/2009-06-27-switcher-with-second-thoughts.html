<p>I'm a veerrry long-time Mac user.&#160; I had one of the first 128K Macs.&#160; I dropped out of college for a while with some friends to develop one of the first Mac applications.&#160; I&#160; worked at Apple for 6 years.&#160; So I am pretty excited about getting back to Macintosh, after having gone to Windows for the past ten years (after my company was bought by Microsoft).&#160; But now that I'm in my second week as a Switcher, I'm frustrated.&#160; The Mac just isn't as great (compared to Windows) as I had hoped it would be. </p>  <p>I'm using an old Macbook Pro with 2GB, so you can probably start by laying the blame on an older machine.&#160; But here are some of my initial frustrations:</p>  <ul>   <li>Macbook Pro keyboard and trackpad placement are poorly designed: my thumb has to travel very far to get to the mouse click. </li>    <li>The mouse seems more critical than on a PC, where nearly everything is easily available with keyboard shortcuts, which I miss. Where's the ALT key? </li>    <li>Video capture doesn't work out of the box. I plugged my camcorder into the firewire port but nothing happened. What's this about Final Cut?&#160; Is it not standard on a MacBook Pro? </li>    <li>The battery is super hot.&#160; I mean, I can't have it on my lap while I'm wearing shorts.&#160; Ouch! </li>    <li>So many things are slooooww.&#160; Safari seems to take forever to load pages, for example.&#160; Maybe this is caused by the lack of RAM, but my Windows laptop is also 2GB.&#160; Is the hard drive speed slow? </li> </ul>  <p>I should write up the list of things I <em>like</em>, because there are many of those things too.&#160; I like the built-in video camera, and the super-cool geek factor of having a full-blown Unix machine at my fingertips.&#160; I also love being able to set up my HP printer with absolutely no extra steps -- it just worked! There are no doubt many more things I'll prefer after having a few more weeks at this.&#160; But in spite of a few nice things, I'm sorry that so far I haven't been blown away.&#160; I guess you need to give me a few more weeks to play and ask me again which I prefer.</p>  <p><a title="IMG_9992" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/3686329014/"><img border="0" alt="IMG_9992" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3007/3686329014_e9ffa9dbdf.jpg" width="369" height="283" /></a></p>
