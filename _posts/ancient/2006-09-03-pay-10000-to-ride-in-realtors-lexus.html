<p>The New York Times has a lengthy article about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/03/business/yourmoney/03real.html?ex=1157428800&amp;en=afb261fa838a869a&amp;ei=5087%0A">pressure on that 6% commision</a> that real estate brokers make, regardless of how much work they do and regardless of the price of the home. The Seattle comany Redfin, featured prominently in the article, is a fully-licensed broker that gives buyers a rebate on the sales commision and is making traditional agents mad.</p> <p>Quotes from Chang-Tai Hsieh, an economist at UC-Berkeley is quoted for pointing out that the 6% system benefits nobody, not even the brokers, who spend most of their time searching for new clients--a fixed system like a retainer or salary&nbsp;would benefit them more.</p> <p>Redfin&nbsp;looks like&nbsp;a cross between an online store (like Amazon) and a traditional hands-on broker. You have to log into their site to get all the info they promise (e.g. neighborhood reports that are more detailed than MLS), so I couldn't check for myself, but the site looks like they understand the online experience.&nbsp; </p> <p>One thing I thought was neat is how when agents refuse to sell to online buyers, Redfin contacts the seller directly.</p>
