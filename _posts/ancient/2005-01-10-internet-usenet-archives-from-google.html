Google just released a <a href="http://www.google.com/googlegroups/archive_announce_20.html">20-year Usenet timeline</a> based on their database of messages sent to the Internet news groups. Fascinating to read, and especially nostalgic for me because it begins in May 1981, only a few months before I had my first account on the ARPA network and started to read these groups myself.<br /><br />via <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/10/0220230&tid=95">Slashdot</a>.<br /><br /><br />
