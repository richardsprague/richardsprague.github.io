<p>The (always interesting) <a href="http://saveseattleschools.blogspot.com/2007/12/really-interesting-article-in-economist.html">Seattle Public Schools blog</a> points to an <a href="http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9989914">Economist article</a> from last year about a large McKinsey world-wide study, "<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/socialsector/resources/pdf/Worlds_School_Systems_Final.pdf">How the world's best-performing schools come out on top</a>".&nbsp; When you systematically compare successful versus unsuccessful school systems, which policies work and which don't?&nbsp; </p> <p>Here's the executive summary:</p> <blockquote> <p>The experiences of these top school systems suggests that three things matter most: 1) getting the right people to become teachers, 2) developing them into effective instructors and, 3) ensuring that the system is able to deliver the best possible instruction for every child.</p></blockquote> <p>Things that don't matter:</p> <ul> <li>School funding (best schools often have the lowest funding, most well-funded schools are often the worst)</li> <li>Class size (in fact, lower class sizes can hurt a school if it results in lower teacher quality)</li> <li>Testing (this is neutral -- sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't)</li></ul> <p>Look at the (mostly anonymous) comments on the Seattle blog and get a sense for why I'm glad to be in the Mercer Island school district instead of Seattle.&nbsp; Many of those commenting seem more interested in ensuring employment for existing teachers than in looking their problems straight in the eye and fixing them.&nbsp; No wonder even <a href="http://www.horsesass.org/?p=3833">die-hard supporters of Seattle-style politics have to flee</a> when their kids leave elementary school.</p>
