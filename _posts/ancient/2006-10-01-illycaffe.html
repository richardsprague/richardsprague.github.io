<p>&nbsp;This week's story about IllyCaffe's <a href="http://www.economist.com/people/displaystory.cfm?story_id=7967814">Head barista</a>&nbsp;reminded me of&nbsp;that excellent&nbsp;espresso I have every time I'm in Europe.&nbsp; I no longer remember exactly, but it's possible that my&nbsp;very first espresso was an Illy, on my trip to Italy in 1993.&nbsp; From the article, it sounds like Mr. Illy should exchange coffee-making tips with <a href="http://richardsprague.blogspot.com/2006/07/espresso-vivace-in-seattle-times.html">David Schomer from Espresso Vivace</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>He says that his firm is inching ever closer to delivering “perfection in every cup”. His particular obsession is with technical innovation. He claims (though some espresso-lovers dispute this), that Illycaffe has been responsible for three of the seven big innovations in coffee-making in the past century, as a traditional Italian craft has become an industrial process. The firm standardised espresso-making, and developed the paper pod containing a single dose of pre-ground coffee for an espresso machine. (Others invented decaffeination, instant coffee, multiple packets and liquid coffee.) Mr Illy is a chemistry graduate—at university he wrote a thesis on the “Quality of Espresso from a Chemical Perspective”—and is as enthusiastic about the science of coffee as he is about its taste. Now Illycaffe is implementing what it regards as its third big innovation. This is a two-stage espresso-making process involving “hyper-fusion” (which intensifies the drink's aroma), and “emulsification” (which makes it smoother).</p></blockquote> <p>Can you buy Illy whole beans&nbsp;in Seattle?&nbsp; <a href="http://www.illyusa.com/AB1666000/showprod.cfm?ObjectGroup_ID=7#">Yes, at</a> Williams-Sonoma at Bellevue Square, plus a few QFCs like the one on NE 8th in Bellevue or on Capitol Hill.</p> <p><img src="http://www.illyusa.com/AB1666000store/images/cof-bean1.jpg"></p>
