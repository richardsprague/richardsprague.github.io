<p>I just listened to an interesting 30-min Econtalk podcast interview with <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2006/07/hanushek_on_edu.html">Rick Hanushek from Stanford,</a> talking about education and how to make schools better.</p> <p>The most interesting part was the discussion about&nbsp;<a href="http://edpro.stanford.edu/hanushek/admin/pages/files/uploads/class_size.ncrel.htm">a study that shows that class sizes</a> don't affect educational outcomes much.&nbsp; After accounting for things like socioeconomic background, teacher education level, geography, etc., it turns out that the difference in outcomes is negligible, even&nbsp;between a 25-student classroom and a 15-student classroom.</p> <p>In fact, he claims that if the goal is to improve student performance, only one thing really matters: teacher quality.&nbsp; The difference between "good" teachers and "bad" teachers is so dramatic that it makes everything else irrelevant.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;It just turns out that some teachers have the ability to take a classroom of kids at any performance level and increase their performance, consistently, year-after-year, regardless of starting level and regardless of all the other variables we ordinarily try to control (salary, class size, textbook spending, etc.)</p> <p>Unfortunately it's very hard to say what makes some teachers better than others. We do know what <em>doesn't</em> matter: graduate degree, years of experience (after a few year start-up period), salary, school district.&nbsp;</p> <p>Here are some of the references:</p> <p>About the failure of spending and smaller class size to improve test scores:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://edpro.stanford.edu/Hanushek/files_det.asp?FileId=93">The Failure of Input-based Schooling Policies</a></li> <li><a href="http://edpro.stanford.edu/Hanushek/content.asp?contentId=73">Class Size</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/PublicSchools.html">Public Schools</a> by John Chubb, in the <i>Concise Encyclopedia of Economics</i></li></ul> <p>About the importance of teacher quality:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://edpro.stanford.edu/Hanushek/content.asp?contentId=60">Teacher Quality</a></li> <li><a href="http://edpro.stanford.edu/Hanushek/files_det.asp?FileId=136">The Market for Teacher Quality</a></li></ul>About the economics of education <ul><br><a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/economics_of_education/index.html">Economics of education</a> at EconLog with Arnold Kling and Bryan Caplan</ul>
