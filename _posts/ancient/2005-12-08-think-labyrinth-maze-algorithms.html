Nathan would love this site that tells you everything you ever wanted to know about <a href="http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm">Mazes</a>.
<br />
<br />It points to a <a href="http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/daedalus.htm">free Windows software download </a>that will generate paper copies of any maze. Maybe I'll try it out one of these days after I confirm it's not laden with spyware.
