A new <a href="http://www.nber.org/w10507">paper </a>by Wharton Prof Peter Cappelli, and discussed in <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/15/1442246&from=rss">Slashdot </a>and <a href="http://slate.com/id/2112215/">Slate</a> points out that the number of private college-educated CEOs in the Fortune 100 has dropped from 54% in 1980 to 42% in 2001.<br /><br />Several speculations are made as to the reason: more money and public universities relative to the Ivies, changing corporate practices that value Ivy Leagues less, and more <a href="http://www.president.harvard.edu/speeches/2004/commencement.html">rich kids in top schools</a> who don't care about work.<br /><br />I think this is a long-term trend. The value of a Harvard or Stanford education is in long-term decline because the democratization of the Internet makes it easier to acquire the same education off-campus, whether through free classes like MIT's Open University, or more educators simply making their knowledge more accessible to communities on the web.<br /><br /><br /><br />
