<p><a href="http://mercerislandblogger.wordpress.com/2008/07/03/where-to-watch-fireworks-if-youre-too-lazy-to-leave-mercer-island/#comments">Surrounded by Water</a> asks the best place to watch fireworks on Mercer Island and my answer is: your back yard!&nbsp; Here's the view from my house on the Fourth evening:</p> <p><a title="4th of July 054" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2639299400/"><img alt="4th of July 054" src="http://static.flickr.com/3124/2639299400_7e791bdfd1.jpg" border="0"></a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Thankfully Mercer Island remains one of the last bastions of true July 4th Freedom in the area: <a href="http://www.ci.mercer-island.wa.us/Page.asp?NavID=2117">residents (not visitors!) are allowed</a> to purchase fireworks (in personal quantities only, of course) and discharge them on private property -- not parks or other public spaces, which are specially patrolled this week to prevent violations.&nbsp; Every so often a busy-body will try to shut down our right to peaceably go pyro like this, so if you're a resident please, <a href="http://www.darwinawards.com/darwin/darwin2007-04.html">please don't be stupid</a> or you'll ruin it for the rest of us.</p>
