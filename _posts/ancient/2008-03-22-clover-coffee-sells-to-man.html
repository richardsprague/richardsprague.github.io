<p>The good news is that soon we're likely to see <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/11/clover-coffee.html">Clover Coffee</a> machines everywhere, now that Starbucks and the Clover Equipment Company <a href="http://cloverequipment.com/home/">have announced plans to merge</a>.&nbsp; <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/11/clover-coffee.html">Like I keep saying</a>, once you've <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2185655/pagenum/all/">tasted coffee from a Clover</a> you won't want to go back to ordinary drip ever again, and I can't wait till it's much easier to find.</p> <p>The coffee business is like a big long line with Starbucks at the front followed waaaayy in the back by everybody else.&nbsp; If you care about flavor, atmosphere, value -- you will always prefer a good local roaster over Starbucks, guaranteed.&nbsp; But sometimes life doesn't present you with other options and frankly, Starbucks is pretty good too.&nbsp; In fact, maybe this will help improve the ratio of <a href="http://seattle.metblogs.com/2008/03/06/wal-mart-and-starbucks-jump-to-your-own-conclusions/">Starbucks per capita in the underserved Wal-Mart</a> parts of the country.</p> <p>Still, I know people who are disappointed that now it looks like Clover won't be able to sell to these smaller, superior coffee shops, which is a shame since these independent guys were what made Clover possible in the first place.</p> <p>But my reaction is that this is all well-deserved goodness for Zander Nosler and his team, who can now focus on building a much more efficient production line, and new products including (Please!) a consumer-priced version.</p> <p>I hope it also serves as a kick in the pants to the local VCs, many of whom were too risk-averse to invest in Clover.&nbsp; There are people out there right now thinking up similarly wonderful product ideas, just waiting for the money and support to make them happen.</p>
