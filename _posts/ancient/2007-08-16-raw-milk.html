<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1076/1144334928_37f9ebe39d.jpg?v=0"> </p> <p>After reading&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/08/dining/08raw.html?ex=1187236800&amp;en=28b9b3825263aa4c&amp;ei=5070&amp;emc=eta1">that NYTimes article</a> last week, plus follow-up at <a href="http://www.rawmilk.com">http://www.rawmilk.com</a> and the <a href="http://whattoeatbook.com/blog/raw-milk-or-raw-deal/">What To Eat blog</a>, I just had to try raw milk for myself.&nbsp; Well, it turns out there is a supplier right here on Mercer Island!&nbsp; <a href="http://www.kaleberg.com/creamery/index.html">Dungeness Valley Creamery</a> is a family farm north of here in Sequim that delivers fresh, <em>unpasteurized</em> milk here every Thursday. Where I grew up in Neillsville Wisconsin, that was no big deal: most people drank milk freshly squeezed from the cows that morning. These days, hyper-protective regulators have made it illegal in 15 states (including, if you can believe it, Wisconsin!)&nbsp;</p> <p>After reading <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/07/reading-omnivore-dilemma.html">Omnivore's Dilemma</a> and hearing an excellent <a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/pages/2007/Aug/hour2_081007.html">podcast interview with its author, Michael Pollan</a>,I've been exploring family farm eating options in the Seattle area, so I was pleasantly surprised to learn that at least one farm delivers right up the street from us.&nbsp; The cost, $8.25/gal is much&nbsp;more than we pay for <a href="http://richardsprague.blogspot.com/2005/06/milkman-cometh.html">Smith Brothers</a>, but the same thing at Whole Foods is $13!</p> <p>I should point out that I'm not an earth-loving hippie by any stretch.&nbsp; Modernization has plenty of problems, but generally I think the world, and humanity's future, is much brighter today than it has ever been. I think it's wonderful that industrialized farmers are able to create so much food and sell it so cheaply.I'm not afraid of GMO, and I actually enjoy eating at McDonalds.&nbsp; &nbsp; For me this is purely about flavor and variety.</p> <p>&nbsp;So what about it? How does it taste?&nbsp; As you would expect from the milk of a Jersey cow, it's very creamy -- rich, like ice cream. The kids like it, though they prefer their regular milk in a blind taste test, but I think that's due to familiarity more than anything.&nbsp; I can't wait to test it with my Espresso Vivace in the morning.</p> <p>If you're interested in trying it yourself, I'm happy to tell you my source, though I'm hesitant to mention it publicly. The woman who runs the Mercer Island drop does it out of her garage, in a very informal setup that won't scale if she gets too much business. <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/08/call-me.html">Call me</a>, or send me an email and I'll give you all the details.</p>
