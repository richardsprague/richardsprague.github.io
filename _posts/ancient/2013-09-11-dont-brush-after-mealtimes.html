<p>Advice from the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323623304579059222363886720.html#articleTabs%3Darticle">WSJ health column</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>"When you eat or drink something acidic, the pH in your mouth goes down and can take some time to go back to normal." The ideal pH of a mouth is about 7, while a soda—even a diet one—can be as low as 2.5 or "about the same as household vinegar," says Dr. Cole. Acid demineralizes and weakens the tooth surface, making it more prone to decay.</p></blockquote> <p>Instead of brushing (which, more than once or twice a day is hard on your teeth), they recommend rinsing your mouth with water to neutralize the pH back to levels that aren’t so helpful to cavity-causing bacteria.</p> <p><a title="Day 241/365: don't forget yer toothbrush" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32174834@N00/9628679386/"><img border="0" alt="Day 241/365: don't forget yer toothbrush" src="http://static.flickr.com/3782/9628679386_3c582492fd.jpg" width="435" height="294"></a></p>
