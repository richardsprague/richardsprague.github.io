I'm still concerned for my brother and his family, who though safe in Houston, have no idea what happened to their house in Kenner (not far from the Esplanade Mall).  Summarizing my <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/katrina+kenner">search for blogs about Katrina and Kenner</a>:<br /><br />My favorite info source so far is this <a href="http://www.scipionus.com/">map</a>, where people post tags stating whatever information they have about specific neighborhoods.<br /><br /><a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/babytreese/Blog/cns!1pcIQs7rs147ia_UAo6C2wOg!740.entry">Babytreese </a>writes about conversations with refugees in Memphis:<br /><br /><blockquote>Rene Mejia, a waiter at Antoine's who lives in the Lower 9th Ward, said he is on the fence whether he will go back or find work elsewhere. "I'm single, I speak four languages, I've got 27 years in the restaurant biz, I can start over anywhere I want."He's in Memphis with nine family members and said ultimately he will go where his family goes. His sister has a condominium in Chateau Estates in Kenner that may be dry, and if his family goes back to New Orleans, he will probably stay with her. He knows he has no home anymore because he lives in the Lower 9th Ward. "Why go back if there is nothing there?"</blockquote><br /><br />A refugee from Kenner, who is now in Memphis posts <a href="http://toddafterkatrina.blogspot.com/2005/09/after-begining.html">this</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://karenquinn.blogspot.com/2005/09/hurricane-katrina.html">Karen Quinn</a> has this quote from her friend Brad on the front lines:<br /><blockquote>...the bricks buried the front of my car and the cab of my sister' truck. (one good thing I GET A NEW CAR!!!!!) my brother threatened suspicious people gathered a few belongings and met my dad in kenner where the business took in 2 inches of water.</blockquote><br /><br />Another <a href="http://cuestadev.blogspot.com/2005/08/katrina-coordinator.html">blog </a>mentions:<br /><blockquote>Jimmy stayed behind at another location, but inspected the Kenner home before also leaving for Orlando. He said therugs inside were water-logged.</blockquote><br />(but I can't see any evidence of exactly which location in Kenner)<br /><br />I've stayed at a La Quinta, not too far from my brother's house, and there is an <a href="http://daily-leisure-and-travel-news.blogspot.com/2005/08/la-quinta-corporation-reports-status.html">announcement that it's closed</a>. Not sure if that's due to any kind of damage.  The <a href="http://daily-leisure-and-travel-news.blogspot.com/2005/08/marriott-update-on-hurricane-katrina.html">Marriott near the airport </a>says it is not accepting reservations and has "marginal operations".<br /><br />A <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/clubduffy/Blog/cns!1p_w46YKcyQyhYj3pYWsBypw!414.entry">single dad</a> posts this:<br /><blockquote>Life has changed, hard part is not knowing what is going on at my home. I live in Kenner near the airport and things are not as bad there as what is on the news, Im near the Esplanade Mall. Hoping to just have water damage but who knows, so excuse me for not laughing or having much funny to say.</blockquote><br /><br />Bigezbear describes his <a href="http://bigezbear.blogspot.com/2005/08/some-hurried-notes-on-hurricane-kat.html">escape from the French Quarter</a> on Sunday morning and says:<br /><blockquote>We saw the city of Kenner under water. The mayor says the damage there is 100%.</blockquote><br /><br />Lots of pictures on this <a href="http://outhouserag.typepad.com/hurricane_watch/2005/08/more_pictures.html">Hurricane Watch </a>site, including this one of the Backyard Barbecue on Veteran's Boulevard.<br /><img src="http://outhouserag.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/22.jpg" title="" width="400" border="0"><br /><br />Anybody else have information about Kenner?  Better yet, do you know of a blog or other source of regularly-updated information?
