<p>My 6-year-old and I biked this afternoon to the <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/08/mercer-island-farmers-market-video.html">Mercer Island Farmers Market</a>, taking advantage of today's unusual sunny weather to stock up on fresh fruit and more.&nbsp; My favorite stand is this one from <a href="http://www.ilovetiny.com/">Tiny's Organic</a>, with their nice assortment of different fruits: mix and match what you want for $4/pound.</p> <p><img height="335" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3293/2838106203_14bd0865c7.jpg?v=0" width="443"> </p> <p>The Farmers Market organizers were doing a survey of attendees.&nbsp; Looks like the vast majority of shoppers are locals, which explains why we kept bumping into people we know.</p> <p><a title="IMG_6712" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2838103049/"><img alt="IMG_6712" src="http://static.flickr.com/3123/2838103049_5542ceda1b.jpg" border="0"></a></p> <p>I love what they have here already, but you know what I hope they do next?&nbsp; More places selling hot meals.&nbsp; The one pizza place is yummy, but too much of a line.&nbsp; I bet there are more people like me who would have stayed longer if we could have easily grabbed some lunch.</p>
