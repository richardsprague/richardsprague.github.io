I just created a new video channel, <a href="http://liveweb.pixpo.com/sprague/index.html">Richard Sprague's Kids</a>, on a new site called PiXPO.<br /><img src="http://www.topdrawerdownloads.com/ef/images/pixpo_150_x_150.jpg" /><br />It's like YouTube, only it streams directly from my PC. That means no mess with uploading to a central server, although my PC must be turned on for you to view content.
