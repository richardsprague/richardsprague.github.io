<p>Our weather is awful: thick ice and snow everywhere, with no prospects for clear roads for at least another week.&#160; I’ve been following the details on the <a href="http://cliffmass.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Cliff Nass Weather Blog,</a> written by the famous University of Washington weather expert, but unfortunately there is not much good news lately.&#160; The best I’ve seen is this snow plow, spotted on Island Crest Way this morning.&#160; I wish there were more of these!</p>  <p><a title="Snow plow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/3130769361/"><img alt="Snow plow" src="http://static.flickr.com/3283/3130769361_ddc7c043eb.jpg" border="0" /></a>    <br />For those of you who read my blog for Mercer Island news, please start checking <a href="http://imercerisland.com/" target="_blank">a new site,</a> where a group of us will be posting more information about local topics: <a href="http://imercerisland.com/" target="_blank">iMercerisland.com</a>.&#160; I just posted a bunch of new photos there as well as on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=mercerisland%20snow%20ice&amp;w=42494318%40N00" target="_blank">my FlickR page</a>.</p>
