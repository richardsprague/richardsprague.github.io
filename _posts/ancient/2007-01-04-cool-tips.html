<p>Kevin Kelly's Cool Tools site strikes again with some <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/cat_tips.php">very neat ideas</a> that make life slightly better:</p> <p>My favorites:</p> <ul> <li>Get some Wintergreen oil (methyl salicylate) at the drugstore for a cheap, extremely effective way to loosen rusted or frozen bolts.</li> <li>Don't bother cleaning paintbrushes between uses, especially between coats. Put them in the freezer instead.</li> <li>Instead of expensive "clip chips", reseal opened bags with those office clip things.</li> <li>Olive oil is the best shaving cream.&nbsp; It's been used for zillions of years and works as well as the $15/can stuff.</li></ul>
