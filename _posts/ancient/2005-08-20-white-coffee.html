<a href="http://davetravel.scripting.com/2005/08/19#a5150">Dave Winer</a> points to <a href="http://www.ancora-coffee.com/roasting.asp">Ancora Coffee</a>, in Madison Wisconsin as a place you can get "white coffee".  Apparently this is a drink made from beans that were only lightly roasted; doesn't taste like coffee but has more caffeine.
