<p>Lately a new feature has begun to appear in our back yard:&nbsp; Little divots, randomly scattered throughout the lawn, as though a golfer or a kid with a shovel has been through here.&nbsp; Very annoying.</p> <p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1129/1438886186_93ef3299c1.jpg?v=0"> </p> <p>Our neighbors have been afflicted by moles,&nbsp;so&nbsp;I suppose it was a matter of time before some of the creatures decided to move in with us too.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ci.mercer-island.wa.us/files/ab4199p1.pdf">Apparently it's illegal to poison or trap them</a>, so unless we decide to welcome the extra aerating for the lawn, we will have to hire a licensed professional.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>
