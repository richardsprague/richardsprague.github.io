<p>The final, certified <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/elections/200711/resPage13.htm">election results are in for Mercer Island</a>, so I spent a few minutes looking over the <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/elections/canvass/2007/index.htm#nov06">detailed precinct-by-precinct results</a> in the City Council race between Mike Cero and Maureen Judge, which Mike won by a slim 51% margin and fewer than 200 votes.&nbsp; <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/11/how-to-win-local-election.html">I've argued that "pothole" issues</a> carried the day, but with a competitor who was new to the island, were there any patterns by neighborhood that explain the results?</p> <p>The answer appears to be yes, that Mike's strong showing in his backyard South End neighborhoods had a big effect.&nbsp; Although both candidates won an equal number of precincts (23 each), the extra push from the South swung the election.&nbsp; Mike's own precinct gave him his best showing (66%). </p> <p>Interestingly, his worst neighborhood (38%) was the same Forest Ave neighborhood that went strongest for Simple Majority, a pattern repeated when you see that the only Lakeridge neighborhoods that Mike lost were the ones that went strongest for Simple Majority.</p> <p>Here's a breakdown by polling station to give you an idea of how people voted across the island:</p> <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="266" border="2"> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top" align="middle" width="198">Neighborhood</td> <td valign="top" align="right" width="64">Votes for Cero</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="198">Island Park School</td> <td valign="top" align="right" width="64">49%</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="198">Islander Middle School</td> <td valign="top" align="right" width="64">55%</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="198">Lakeridge</td> <td valign="top" align="right" width="64">56%</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="198">Boys &amp; Girls Club</td> <td valign="top" align="right" width="64">47%</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="198">City Hall</td> <td valign="top" align="right" width="64">52%</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="198">Fire Station</td> <td valign="top" align="right" width="64">47%</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="198">High School</td> <td valign="top" align="right" width="64">51%</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="198">West Mercer</td> <td valign="top" align="right" width="64">50%</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>(I'm still looking for a GIS-format map of Mercer Island that would let me show the results in a pretty color chart. If you have one, please <a href="mailto:richardsprague+blogger@gmail.com">let me know</a> and I'll share the rest of my SQL data with you)</p>
