<p>They started&nbsp;in Portland about a year ago, but now Google Transit has a site for Seattle.&nbsp; </p> <p>For example, it says that for me to get from <a href="http://www.google.com/transit?ll=47.562723,-122.146319&amp;spn=0.407366,0.360521">home to my office</a> right now (at 6:30 on a Saturday morning) would take 58 minutes.&nbsp; That is, 58 minutes after my bus arrives near home, which won't be till 8:52am.</p> <p>It seems to be hooked into the same GPS systems used by other sites, but the UI is the best I've seen yet.</p>
