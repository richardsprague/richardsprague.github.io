<p>Mike Cero, <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/04/mike-cero-carbon-challenge.html">always looking for cost-effective ways to help the environment</a>,&nbsp; invited me to help test drive an electric car now available for sale from <a href="http://mcelectricvehicles.com/index.php">MC Electric Vehicles</a>, a local dealership that specializes in green vehicles.</p> <p>We tried the <a href="http://mcelectricvehicles.com/itemdetail.php?itemid=4&amp;subid=3">ZX40S</a>, a 4-seater hatchback from <a href="http://www.milesev.com/">Miles Electric Vehicles</a>, and the first street-legal Chinese-made auto sold in America.&nbsp; Good Clean Tech rated them the "<a href="http://www.goodcleantech.com/2007/12/video_miles_automotive_ev_for.php">Electric Car Company of 2007",</a> and they're getting some buzz among die-hards who want no-pollution cars.&nbsp; This one is solidly-built, though very basic:&nbsp; no power steering or air conditioning, and since it won't go faster than 35mph you can't use it on the freeway.&nbsp; But it might be perfect as a fleet vehicle for organizations looking for short-range shuttle cars, or for people who do all short trips in a small community like Mercer Island.</p> <p>In terms of performance and handling, the part I love about electrics is their quiet ride.&nbsp; My Prius goes into silent all-electric mode too, but you hear the engine again when you accelerate.&nbsp; Not so with the ZX40S: it's quiet all the time.&nbsp; In fact, it's so quiet we joked that you might need to take extra measures to ensure bicyclists can hear you on the road--it really runs silently.</p> <p>Of course the big advantage of an electric car is the complete lack of a gas tank.&nbsp; It says it charges in about 8 hours (i.e. overnight), giving you a range of about 50 miles.&nbsp; We didn't test it that far, but I think you'd want to be careful counting on it past 30 miles or so.&nbsp; The range seems to depend on how hilly the area is and how much load you have in the car (i.e. total passenger and cargo weight).&nbsp; Of course, if you run low on a charge it's a simple matter of plugging it into the closest electric outlet.&nbsp; (But be careful: it has to be a 20 amp outlet--not the more typical 15A sockets you'd normally find in your house).</p> <p>So how did it do?&nbsp; I think in a flat area this car would be just fine, but there's not a lot of oomph for climbing.&nbsp; We found it slow going up some of the more challenging Mercer Island areas (like Gallagher Hill), especially as the charge runs down.&nbsp; And as I noted, it's only legal for road speeds under 35mph, so you're limited to neighborhood driving.</p> <p>The price, about $23K including taxes and everything, is about what you'd pay for a basic Prius--which has a lot more power and flexibility.&nbsp; Still, if you live in a flat area, don't need high speeds, and you want zero-pollution without the hassle or expense of going to a gas station, this car will do what it says.&nbsp; Meanwhile I think I'll wait for MC Electric to start carrying the Miles XS500, the new Camry-sized 80MPH luxury model scheduled to go on sale later this year.</p> <p><a title="IMG_6203" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2660495979/"><img alt="IMG_6203" src="http://static.flickr.com/3074/2660495979_4f845e52e9.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
