Virginia Postrel of Dynamist.com says what I mean: <a href="http://www.dynamist.com/articles-speeches/opeds/npr-variety.html">the variety revolution is making us all richer</a> in ways not usually reflected in mainstream economic statistics. 
<br />
<br />She shows calculations about the "consumer surplus", the extra benefit to consumers when the precise item they want can be purchased for less money than they're willing to pay, is $1B at Amazon.com.  In other words, there are obscure books for which I'd be willing to pay extra to buy, and I only found them because of the Internet, where I'm able to buy them at the normal price.
<br />
<br />You can find the author of the paper, Erik Brynjolfsson from MIT, at <a href="http://ebusiness.mit.edu/erik/">http://ebusiness.mit.edu/erik/</a>
