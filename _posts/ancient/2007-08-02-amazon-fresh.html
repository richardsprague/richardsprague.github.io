<p><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/omaha/images/logo-amazonFresh-splashLanding.gif"> </p> <p>I see their trucks regularly, and now apparently the full news has been leaked to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/08/01/remember-webvan-so-does-amazon/trackback/">TechCrunch</a> and even <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118607975263886360.html?mod=djemTECH">the Wall Street Journal:</a> Amazon delivers groceries to Mercer Island.&nbsp; (<a href="http://fresh.amazon.com/">Sign up on line</a>)</p> <ul> <li>No minimum order  <li>Free pickup and delivery  <li>Pick up same day at their local station  <li>Delivery in a 1-hour time window you specify</li></ul> <p>We used WebVan quite a bit when we lived in California, at least at first, and occasionally still use the free delivery that Safeway offers locally.&nbsp;&nbsp; We couldn't live without our <a href="http://richardsprague.blogspot.com/2005_06_01_archive.html">weekly milk truck</a> or the <a href="http://richardsprague.blogspot.com/2007/07/reading-omnivore-dilemma.html">separate organic food</a> delivery, but I'm not optimistic about a general-purpose system like Amazon:</p> <ul> <li>It doesn't truly replace grocery shopping. They screw up the order often enough that we often end up going back to the store anyway to get one thing we forgot -- and then, what's the point?  <li>I don't trust the produce unless I can look at it first.&nbsp; Pioneer Organics tells me up-front that the order will have variability -- the&nbsp;straight-from-the-farm aspect is part of their appeal.&nbsp; But how do I know if Amazon's blueberries are really ripe?</li></ul> <p>I hope they stay in business, though, if only because I like the peace of mind to know that I can order online when necessary, like if we'll be returning from out of town or if we ran out of something and don't want to go to the store before tomorrow morning.</p> <p>Anybody else on Mercer Island had experience with Amazon Fresh yet?</p>
