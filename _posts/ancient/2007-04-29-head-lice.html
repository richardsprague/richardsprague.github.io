<blockquote> <p></p></blockquote> <p>This five-minute <a href="http://soundmedicine.iu.edu/podcast/040107_2.mp3">podcast from Sound Medicine</a> at Indiana School of Medince should be mandatory listening to everyone with a child enrolled at Mercer Island elementary schools. Based on <a href="http://www.pidj.com/pt/re/pidj/home.htm;jsessionid=G0fQXQCy3TVDGfR7TjhqQby1RRq6X4LLvRyvhbCctp5spDcynxlJ!-1465501618!-949856144!8091!-1">new, systematic research by Richard J. Pollack</a> and other epidemiologists from Harvard, scientists have concluded that:  <ul> <li>Lice spread only by head-to-head contact -- not from sharing hats or combs.  <li>Personal hygiene has no affect one way or another on incidents of infestation  <li>Even school nurses generally have only a 50% accuracy rate when diagnosing an infestation.</li></ul> <p>Here's what the <a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/headlice.html">Harvard School of Public Health</a> says:  <ul> <li>Sending children home in order to reduce transmission of lice is "virtually always counter-productive."  <li>Head lice spread far less easily than cold or flu virus.  <li>"We are unaware of any convincing data that demonstrates that enforced exclusion policies are effective in reducing the transmission of lice. "</li></ul> <p>Here's a <a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/headlice/flow2.html">data sheet with recommendations</a> for how to manage a head lice infestation at school. Basic idea:  <ol> <li>Don't bother with the nits; thoroughly remove <em>live</em> lice with a louse comb every day or two for a week.</li> <li>Try chemicals if that doesn't work.</li></ol>
