Remember my <a href="http://richardsprague.blogspot.com/2005/09/fixing-camcorder.html">broken camcorder</a>?  The one I paid $260 to repair, and just received back in the mail?
<br />
<br />Well now I see this from Panasonic:<a href="http://www.pana3ccduser.com/showthread.php?p=30514#post30514">Panasonic 3CCD User - Important Recall Notice On PV-DV953 And PV-GS200#post30514</a>
<br />
<br /><blockquote>Panasonic has discovered a premature component failure with a limited number of PV-DV953 (2003 Model) and PV-GS200 (2004 Model) 3CCD camcorders, which may cause an abnormal camera picture (incorrect color reproduction, reddish, noisy image, etc). This anomaly is limited to a specific range of serial numbers listed below.
<br />
<br />If your camcorder demonstrates the specific symptom and falls within the serial number range, Panasonic will repair the camcorder free of charge.
<br />
<br />Please call the following toll-free number for assistance in receiving a free repair:

<br />Panasonic Call Center: 1-800-973-4264
