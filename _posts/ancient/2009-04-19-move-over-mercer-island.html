<p>The weather has finally changed enough that I can close my eyes and imagine it’s springtime, and that’s a good time to think about adjusting a bunch of things, including my blogs.&#160; When I started years ago, this blog was a central place to keep my stuff.&#160; Why post book reviews at Amazon, or restaurant opinions on Yelp, or advice about contractors at &lt;fly-by-night websites&gt; when it’s just easier to keep track of everything on my own site?&#160; Plus, the engineer in me says if you want to understand the Web you need to <a href="http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2009/02/can_you_advise.php" target="_blank">jump in and do it yourself</a>—don’t just read about it.&#160;&#160; The downside of this is that my blog has tended to be a bit of a jungle: a little of this, a little of that, with no obvious theme or relevance to anybody but me.&#160; (Even my mom doesn’t read me that much anymore). </p>  <p>So I’m switching to be a bit more thematical and that means focusing my posts in a way I didn’t in the past.&#160; I didn’t expect that so many people would read me for the <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/search/label/Mercer%20Island" target="_blank">posts I made about Mercer Island</a>.&#160; I love it here, of course, but unless you do too it’s not going to be all that interesting.&#160;&#160; Careful readers will note that I haven’t posted much about Mercer Island lately&#160; because for the past several months I’ve been posting instead on a new site: <a href="http://www.imercerisland.com/" target="_blank">iMercerIsland.com.</a>&#160; Go there if you want to read about local issues.&#160; I may cross-post now and then, but generally speaking from now on richardsprague.com will be more about general ideas that I find interesting and less about the wonderful place where I happen to live.</p>  <p>The nice thing about iMercerIsland.com is that it’s open to posters besides me, so feel free to contribute yourself (<a href="mailto: richardsprague+mi@gmail.com" target="_blank">email me</a> if you want to learn how).&#160; </p>  <p>By the way, if you want to get even more up-to-date MI information, you’ll want to <a href="http://twitter.com/mercerisland" target="_blank">follow Mercer Island on Twitter</a>.&#160; See you there!</p>  <p><a title="Prius and Tulips in the Springtime." href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/3453288866/"><img alt="Prius and Tulips in the Springtime." src="http://static.flickr.com/3373/3453288866_a0fc37092f.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>
