<p>Spectacular volcanoes are another reason <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/04/interesting-facts-about-costa-rica.html">Costa Rica is like Hawaii</a>, only cheaper.&nbsp; The best example of this is the <a href="http://www.arenal.net/">Arenal volcano</a>, as seen from the window of our plane:</p> <p><a title="Arenal Volcano from air" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2408680930/"><img alt="Arenal Volcano from air" src="http://static.flickr.com/2179/2408680930_7b9a220f1b.jpg" border="0"></a></p> <p>Here's the same volcano as we saw it from our room in the morning at the <a href="http://www.arenal.net/observatory-lodge/">Arenal Observatory Lodge</a>. All day and night you hear booming explosive sounds of hot boulders crashing down the sides of the mountain. Supposedly it's totally safe for us this far away, though a tourist was killed was a few years ago, apparently from hiking too close when the volcano was having a bad day.</p> <p><a title="Lava flowing down Arenal volcano in Costa Rica" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2407851137/"><img alt="Lava flowing down Arenal volcano in Costa Rica" src="http://static.flickr.com/2367/2407851137_15fa7795f1.jpg" border="0"></a></p> <p>That lodge is a great place to stay, by the way.&nbsp; Our family (3 kids) is too big for a single room, but we were able to get two rooms side-by-side in what they call the Smithsonian section of the hotel. The view, as you can see, is spectacular, but that's not all.&nbsp; There's a wonderful "infinity pool" just outside the room, and plenty of nature hiking.&nbsp; The rates are on the order of what you'd pay at a Holiday Inn in a big US city ($100-$150), and include good US-style breakfast food. </p> <p>The only downside of the lodge is its remote location.&nbsp; It's an hour-long, very bumpy ride up a desolate but well-traveled road.&nbsp; No dangerous cliffs or curves, but you will be very glad when you reach the top.</p>
