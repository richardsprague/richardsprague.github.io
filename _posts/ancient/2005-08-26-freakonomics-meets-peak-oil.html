<p>The <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2005/08/betting-on-peak-oil.html">Freakonomics Blog</a><a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2005/08/betting-on-peak-oil.html"></a>&nbsp;continues to dissect the Peak Oil arguments:</p><p><em>John Tierney wrote a great <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/23/opinion/23tierney.html?n=Top%2fOpinion%2fEditorials%20and%20Op%2dEd%2fOp%2dEd%2fColumnists%2fJohn%20Tierney&amp;oref=login">New York Times column </a>in response<br />to the Maass article on Peak Oil in the Sunday NY Times Magazine<br />that I criticized. Tierney and <a href="http://www.simmonsco-intl.com/research.aspx?Type=msspeeches">Matthew Simmons</a>, who is the point man for the Peak Oil team, made a $10,000 bet as to whether in 2010 oil would be above or below $200 a barrel (adjusted for inflation to be in 2005 dollars). The bet was designed in the spirit of the famous bet between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wager_between_Julian_Simon_and_Paul_Ehrlich">Julian Simon and Paul Ehrlich</a>, which the economist Simon won when the five commodities Ehrlich said would rise in price, actually fell substantially.</em></p><p>I made an similar bet with a guy at work, though on a smaller scale.&nbsp;After some studying of the Peak Oil arguments, I am convinced that this whole &ldquo;we&rsquo;re running out of oil&rdquo; argument is just another example of an irrational panic meme that will end in tons of even cheaper energy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
