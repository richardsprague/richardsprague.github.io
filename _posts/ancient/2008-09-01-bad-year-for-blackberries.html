<p>The empty lot near my house is always chock full of invasive <a href="http://www.kingcounty.gov/environment/animalsAndPlants/noxious-weeds/weed-identification/blackberry.aspx">Himalayan blackberry bushes</a>, and each August my kids and I enjoy picking bucketful after bucketful without really trying.&nbsp; But for some reason, this year doesn't seem nearly as bountiful, with smaller berries and long thorny branches.&nbsp; We went to Luther Burbank park this afternoon and even there, the bushes didn't seem as loaded as the last few years. It's late in the season, so I expect the crop to have dwindled, but earlier in August wasn't all that much better.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <p><a title="Blackberries in Luther Burbank Park" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2819567063/"><img height="288" alt="Blackberries in Luther Burbank Park" src="http://static.flickr.com/3164/2819567063_69423dbd8c.jpg" width="384" border="0"></a></p> <p>I'm not sure what to blame:&nbsp; <strike>global warming,</strike> <strike>George Bush</strike>, the unseasonably cool summer, <strike>my imagination</strike>?</p>
