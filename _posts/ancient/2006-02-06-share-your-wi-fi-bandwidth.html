It's amazing it took so long for somebody to do this.  <a href="http://en.fon.com/help/faq.php">FON</a> is a Spanish company that is organizing a world-wide list of Wi-Fi access points.  Anyone (including me!) who has a wireless router can join.  If you agree to host the FON software on your access point, you get rights to every other FON user's access point.<br /><br />So simply by making my home wireless free to my neighborhood in Mercer Island, I can access any other FON site in the world for free too.<br /><img src=http://en.fon.com/img/logofon.gif>
