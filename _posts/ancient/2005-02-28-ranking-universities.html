I always took it for granted that public California universities are great, but how about the University of Washington?<br /><img src="http://www.washington.edu/home/graphics/home/logo.gif" title="" border="0"><br /><br /><a href="http://ed.sjtu.edu.cn/rank/2004/Top%20100%20North%20&%20Latin%20American%20Universities.htm">Rankings </a>of the top universities show that U-W Seattle is #17 in the U.S., #20 in the world, just behind famous places like University of Wisconsin and Univ of Michigan.<br /><br />Note that Brown University is ranked way lower, at #51.<br /><img src="http://www.brown.edu/web/photos/1.jpg" title="" border="0"><br />
