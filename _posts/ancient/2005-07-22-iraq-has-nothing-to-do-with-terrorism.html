<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/22/opinion/22roy.html?">Why Do They Hate Us? Not Because of Iraq - New York Times</a>: "If the conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq and Palestine are at the core of the radicalization, why are there virtually no Afghans, Iraqis or Palestinians among the terrorists? Rather, the bombers are mostly from the Arabian Peninsula, North Africa, Egypt and Pakistan - or they are Western-born converts to Islam. Why would a Pakistani or a Spaniard be more angry than an Afghan about American troops in Afghanistan? It is precisely because they do not care about Afghanistan as such, but see the United States involvement there as part of a global phenomenon of cultural domination."

<br />People forget that 9/11 (by far the worst terrorist incident in history) happened <em>before </em>the invasion of Afghanistan or Iraq.
