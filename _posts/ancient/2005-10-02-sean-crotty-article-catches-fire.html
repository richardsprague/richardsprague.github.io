<br />Ebay is an open API that lets you, say, get an up-to-date list of the most popular search terms and add that to your application. That becomes powerful when you combine it with other web services, like Google Maps or Virtual Earth.<p>

<br />Sean points to <a href="http://www.trachtenberg.com/emgm/">this web service</a> that shows all the used cars for sale near you.
