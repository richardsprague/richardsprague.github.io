Sometimes it is a full day of relaxing at home in Chappaqua; sometimes it is meeting up late at night. At their busiest, they saw each other on a single day, Valentine's Day, in February 2005 ï¿½ a month when each was traveling a great deal. Last August, they saw each other at some point on 24 out of 31 days. Out of the last 73 weekends, they spent 51 together. The aides declined to provide the Clintons' private schedule.<br /></blockquote><br /><img src="http://graphics10.nytimes.com/images/2006/05/22/nyregion/23clinton.1901.jpg" />
