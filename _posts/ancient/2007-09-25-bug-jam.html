<p>Last night we went to <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/09/burke-museum-bug-blast.html">the Bug Jam</a>, sponsored by the <a href="http://crawford.tardigrade.net/Scarabs.html">Scarab Society</a> and&nbsp;hosted at the University of Washington Burke Museum&nbsp; I was surprised at the turnout: about 25 people of all ages, about half kids half adults.&nbsp; Many of them are obviously regulars, and some of the older adults are seriously hard-core.&nbsp; One woman (a teacher) came from Federal Way; another man (retired) drove from Enumclaw just for this.&nbsp; </p> <p>Entomologist Sharon Collman (recently <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/PrintStory.pl?document_id=2003892106&amp;slug=nwwnaturalwanders200&amp;date=20070920">profiled in the Seattle Times</a>) led the discussion, with informal presentations by attendees showing off their latest prized finding.&nbsp; There were plenty of experts on hand to identify various mysterious creatures people had with them.</p> <p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1260/1437498105_e3f1e3f301.jpg?v=0"> </p> <p>One collector showed off some of his prizes, the smallest beetles on earth, captured at his home.&nbsp; We also saw a wasp-like thing (I can't remember the name) that is attracted to wood fires, of all things, so it can lay eggs in places like forest fires where its young will grow up surrounded by fresh vegetation.&nbsp; All-in-all an interesting event, and not to be missed if you are fascinated by the insects of the Northwest. Held the fourth Monday of each month.</p>
