<p>This week’s <a href="http://popupchinese.com/lessons/sinica/inscrutable-china">Sinica podcast</a> notes how a foreigner will never be accepted as a China expert, that Chinese people will always claim that true understanding of China is the exclusive domain of native Chinese. </p>  <p>You hear the same excuse in Japan, though possibly less so as the Japanese become more comfortable being thought of as a Western, not Eastern power.</p>  <p>Americans just don’t think that way. Anyone can offer a perspective about the United States and be regarded as an “expert” if they put in the time or show some quality in their observations.&#160; We’ll even accept a foreign publication, like <a href="http://www.economist.com" target="_blank">The Economist</a> or the BBC, as a better arbiter of the truth than many homegrown equivalents. Somebody like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0060956666" target="_blank">Alexis de Toqueville</a> is respected as one of the best American observers of all time.</p>  <p>You can tell the self-confidence of a culture to the degree that respects external experts.</p>
