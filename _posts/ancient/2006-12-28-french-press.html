<p>My other favorite Christmas present is this <a href="http://bonjourproducts.com/53470.html">French Press</a> from Bonjour Products:</p> <p><img src="http://bonjourproducts.com/images/53470_b.jpg"> </p> <p>It makes 3 cups of incredibly tasty, rich coffee or tea.&nbsp; Just grind the beans (to the large French press size), plop them in, pour boiling water, and wait 4 minutes.</p> <p>Cleaning up is the hardest part,&nbsp;but still very easy -- certainly easier than an espresso machine. Pouring water over the filter mechanism seems to get it clean enough for daily use. I should probably soak it in soapy water and rinse it thoroughly every so often just to keep it spotless.</p> <p>Coffeegeek.com has <a href="http://www.coffeegeek.com/guides/presspot">thorough instructions</a> for how to use press pots.</p>
