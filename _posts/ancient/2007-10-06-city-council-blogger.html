<p>Randy Corman, Renton City Councilman for 14 years, has <a href="http://www.randycorman.com/">a blog that he updates nearly every day</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people think Mercer Island could use&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mi-reporter.com/articles/2007/10/04/opinion/letters/letter1.txt">televised city council</a> proceedings, and I don't disagree, but a blog is so much better.&nbsp; You really get a sense of what a public official is up to.</p> <p>Local officials and candidates send dozens of emails each day.&nbsp; They could save time by simply posting their daily thoughts on line and pointing others to it.&nbsp; </p> <p>Incidentally I just noticed that Mike Cero has a <a href="http://www.voteforcero.org/?page_id=9">regular newsletter</a> (the latest was just published <a href="http://www.voteforcero.org/wp-content/cero-for-mercer-island-city-council-newsletter-v1i2.pdf">October 2nd</a>).&nbsp; It's quite informative, and gives you a good sense of what he stands for.&nbsp; Too bad it's only in PDF, which is annoying to read on line and doesn't show up in Google searches.&nbsp;Still, it's much more information than you get about the other candidates, none of whom has any online updates that I can see.</p>
