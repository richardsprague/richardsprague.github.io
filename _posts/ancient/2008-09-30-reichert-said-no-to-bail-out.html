<p>Mercer Island’s congressman, Dave Reichert, <a href="http://reichert.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=104078">voted against the $700B bail-out</a> of the financial industry.&#160; A bunch of my friends are getting ready to jump out windows over this and I just can’t figure out why. Am I the only one who thinks a spending package this big deserves a lot more debate?&#160; By all accounts, the economy is still growing; inflation and unemployment are relatively low, historically.&#160; What exactly is the government “rescuing” here in such a hurry?</p>  <p>It’s especially strange to me that many of the same people who opposed the Iraq invasion because it was too rushed (“give the inspectors more time”) are now supporting a hugely expensive bill that was thrown together in a few days, with no time for serious public discussion. </p>  <p>Incidentally, Reichert’s opponent in the election, Darcy Burner, <a href="http://www.darcyburner.com/news/stories/darcy_says_no_blank_check_in_bailout_proposal/">talks against the bail-out as well</a>, though it’s hard to say if she would have bucked her own party leadership to oppose it.</p>  <p>Help me out here.&#160; Commentators on both the left and the right are absolutely convinced that Reichert’s refusal to spend $700B is going to lead to another Great Depression, but I just don’t get it.&#160; What am I missing?</p>  <p>Updates:&#160; Reichert <a href="http://reichert.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=104413">voted against the second version</a> as well, but this time it passed and appears headed into law.&#160; I still don’t understand the arguments in favor, but note that many people I respect think it was urgently needed.&#160; (See <a href="http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2008/10/1">Warren Buffett</a>, <a href="http://www.rttnews.com/Content/AllEconomicNews.aspx?Node=B2&amp;Id=720638">Jeremy Siegel</a>, <a href="http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fpmagazinedaily/archive/2008/10/03/robert-shiller-jr-why-wall-street-is-crashing-and-why-the-bailout-is-right.aspx">Robert Schiller</a>).&#160; </p>
