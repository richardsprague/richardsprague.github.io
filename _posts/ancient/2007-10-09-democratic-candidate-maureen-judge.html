<p>Okay, here it is in black and white about what Maureen Judge supporters think about the&nbsp;supposedly&nbsp;non-partisan City Council election:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Democrats are building a deep, deep bench with candidates like <a href="http://www.maureenjudge.com/">Maureen Judge</a> in Mercer Island and <a href="http://www.keriandrews.com/">Keri Andrews</a> in Bellevue.</p></blockquote> <p>[from <a href="http://www.horsesass.org/?p=3537">horsesass.org]</a></p> <p>I have no doubt that Maureen is intelligent, caring, and laser-focused on the politics of winning an election. But how interested, really, is she in local affairs?&nbsp; I bet she couldn't care less about the <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/09/road-narrows.html">traffic on my street</a> (not enough voters), or about issues that matter to my school (too local).&nbsp; </p> <p>Why doesn't she run for state legislature, or Congress?&nbsp; I might vote for her.&nbsp; But if she wins the City Council election, who's going to represent me on zoning issues or&nbsp;traffic or parks?&nbsp; </p> <p>The Internet is changing everything, including politics,&nbsp;to be hyper-individualized and hyper-local. Maureen is taking a logical step -- use <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/08/off-islanders-for-maureen-judge.html">non-local money</a> and national issues to convince voters they can trust her.&nbsp; In the long, long run, that won't work, as online tools like Facebook make it ultra-easy for local/individual issues to trump national ones.&nbsp; In a few years,&nbsp;a newcomer supported mostly by outside interests will be ignored.</p> <p>Meanwhile this election will be an interesting test.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can <a href="http://www.voteforcero.org/">Mike Cero</a>, with his close <em>personal</em> connections to Islanders, trump somebody whose only relationship to voters&nbsp;is their party affiliation?</p> <p>Bonus question: what would happen if Maureen campaigned openly as a Democrat?&nbsp; Would she gain or lose more votes overall?&nbsp; </p>
