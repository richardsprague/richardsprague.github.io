<p></p> <p>Yesterday, on the hottest day so far this year, my Prius check engine light came on. It was still on in the morning, though it mysteriously turned itself off after another cycle or two. Then I plugged in the ODB analyzer, and here are the error codes it showed: <ul> <li>P1121: Accelerator pedal position sensor range/performance problem.</li> <li>P0125: Insufficient coolant temp for closed loop fuel control.</li></ul> <p>I found a nice listing of DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Codes) <a href="http://www.ecrostech.com/prius/GenInfo/DTCs/TroubleCodes.htm">here</a>, but it wasn't much help beyond what I already found from the analyzer. I showed the codes to the Toyota Service people who recommend I take it in. So much for Toyota zero-defect engineering.</p>
