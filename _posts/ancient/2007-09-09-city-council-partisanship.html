<p>Many people have been responding to my observation that much of the <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/08/off-islanders-for-maureen-judge.html">campaign money for Maureen Judge comes from off-island special interests</a> -- nearly as much as she receives from Mercer Island residents themselves.&nbsp; Now three people have asked me to take a closer look at Mike Cero's donors, which <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/09/more-on-maureen-judge-campaign.html">I called "boring"</a> because they're all from individuals, not national organizations.&nbsp; Maureen's funding and endorsements come from the Democratic party and orgs typically associated with Democrats,&nbsp;like NARAL (Pro-Choice) and the Sierra Club. Peek into Mike's funding, I was told, and you'll find Republicans.</p> <p>Sure enough.&nbsp; I won't bother naming people, since they're individuals and not organizations, but <a href="http://www.campaignmoney.com/">you can check for yourself</a>. Looks like Mike received several contributions since I did my last check of the <a href="http://web.pdc.wa.gov/servlet/ContServlet">Public Disclosure Commission database</a>, and what do you know, some of these so-called MI residents are&nbsp;donors to&nbsp;national political campaigns too!</p> <p>Seriously, I suppose if we were going to do this right we'd check every single individual on both campaigns, look into their past history and decide whether they're more "Republican" or "Democrat".&nbsp; But I'm not convinced that a private donation from an Islander who happens to donate to other causes, is the same as a check from an off-island special interest group.&nbsp; This is an election for city council, for crying out loud, an office that influences road construction and zoning, not the War in Iraq.&nbsp;If individual MI residents, out of their own pockets, choose to donate to a local campaign, then who am I to say they're doing it for partisan reasons?</p> <p>On the other hand, when an <em>organization</em> based in Olympia or Washington D.C. donates,&nbsp; I have to wonder&nbsp;what would motivate their central committees to spend precious donations to influence an election in a place where they will never set foot.&nbsp; And remember,&nbsp;we're talking about a&nbsp;local government office that,&nbsp;being non-partisan, has nothing to say about Supreme Court nominees, or logging&nbsp;in state parks,&nbsp;or whatever&nbsp;pressing international issues that matter to national political groups.</p> <p>I want City Council members who will <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/09/road-narrows.html">fix my roads</a>, ensure good cooperation between the City and the schools, and <a href="http://www.ci.mercer-island.wa.us/members.asp?memberid=331">avoid embarrassment</a>.&nbsp; I trust that every individual MI resident who gave to Mike (or Maureen) has some interest in those issues as well.&nbsp; But Maureen's biggest donor is the Washington Conservation Voters.&nbsp; If they really cared about Mercer Island, I bet they'd be upset that her campaign signs are still polluting Island Crest Way.</p> <p><a href="http://islandrepublican.blogspot.com/">How about it Republicans</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;Maureen is using state- and national political donations to fund her City Council campaign. Are you going to sit this one out?</p>
