We attended the beginning of last night's <a href="http://www.misd.k12.wa.us/board/agenda/04-05/agenda1_27_05.html">MISD board meeting</a>, which featured an important presentation by Stowe Sprague, who was there with a few other moms and members of the <a href="http://www.mipreschoolassociation.org/">Mercer Island Preschool Association</a>.  They are trying to get more attention for preschool and daycare issues for children under 6, particularly in light of a new building project being considered by the school district.
