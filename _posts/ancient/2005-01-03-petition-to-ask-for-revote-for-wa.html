The election was a statistical tie. With so many total votes cast, and so many opportunities for errors (human and mechanical), you will get a different result each time you count, so there is no way to know who really won the election.
<br />
<br />It's not that expensive to simply hold a new run-off, and you can sign an on-line petition to ask that we do that.
