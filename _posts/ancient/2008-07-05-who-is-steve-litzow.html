<p>As I keep saying, local elections are more relevant than national ones, and for Mercer Island you need to know about the choices for 41st district state legislature, Marcie Maxwell and Steve Litzow. Since I <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/06/who-is-marcie-maxwell.html">already mentioned Marcie</a>, I need to say a few words about Steve as well.&nbsp; Or better yet, let Steve speak for himself.&nbsp; I met him the other day at <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/02/i-tull.html">Tully's</a>, where he talked to me about his background and some thoughts about how to improve <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/search/label/Education">education</a>.</p> <p><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Cn4201VWhR4" width="425" height="350" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></p> <p>Both <a href="http://www.marciemaxwell.org/">Marcie</a> and <a href="http://www.stevelitzow.com/">Steve</a> are easy (and eager!) to meet people in our district, so if you care about local issues, don't be shy: get to know them before you make up your mind.</p>
