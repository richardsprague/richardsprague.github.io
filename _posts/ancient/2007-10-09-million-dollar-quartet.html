<p>We endured rain at the Issaquah Salmon Festival again this year (in <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2005/10/if-youre-thinking-of-salmon-days-in.html">spite of my previous experiences</a> there) to attend a performance of <a href="http://www.villagetheatre.org/mainstage_0708-mdq.shtml">Million Dollar Quartet</a> at the Village Theatre.</p> <p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2382/1515466053_06bf3dfea6.jpg?v=0"> </p> <p>As predicted, the music was excellent -- I think the casting call went to musicians, not actors.&nbsp; The plot, if you can call it that, was so-so.&nbsp; It described a legendary meeting of Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Elvis Presley, and Jerry Lee Lewis, so as you might expect, most of the people in the audience were senior citizens.</p> <p>The American South is a remarkable place, sometimes associated (incorrectly, I think) with backwardness and poverty, but it's also at the core of America, as you can see from the contributions Southerners have made to American culture with Jazz, Blues, Rock N Roll, not to mention most of our post-War U.S. Presidents.&nbsp; People from the Coasts, or foreigners: if you want to really understand America, you need to understand the South.</p>
