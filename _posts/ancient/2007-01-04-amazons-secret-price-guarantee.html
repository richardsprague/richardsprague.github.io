I didn't know that Amazon has a <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2156900/fr/rss/">secret price guarantee</a>. They'll refund the difference if something drops in price within 30 days after you purchase.<br /><br />There's even a <a href="http://www.frozenwarrior.com/~pricewatch/">website </a>that will email you if that happens.<br /><br />You have to call Amazon (no email) to get the refund.  Call 1-800-201-7575; to get a human right away, dial extension 7.
