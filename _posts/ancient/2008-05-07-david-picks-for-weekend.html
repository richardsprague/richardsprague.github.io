<p>My long-time work friend David Burd has a reputation as the guy around the office who always seems to have something fun planned for the weekend.&nbsp; He's lived in the Northwest forever, so he knows everything, and his activities always revolve around family too, so the rest of us with kids like to ask him what he's doing. Well, now he's formalized his lists of things to do and is posting them to a web site: <a href="http://davidspicks.spaces.live.com/default.aspx">David's Picks</a>.</p> <p>Best bet this weekend looks like the Mother's Day Social at the <a href="http://www.bellevuebotanical.org/">Bellevue Botanical Gardens</a>.&nbsp; My in-laws are in town, so maybe I can get them to take the kids there tomorrow so I can veg out at home :-)</p>
