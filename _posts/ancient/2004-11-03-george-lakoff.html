He's mostly known in the linguistics community, but <a href="http://www.wwcd.org/issues/Lakoff.html#STRICT">George Lakoff</a> is also now promoting himself as a liberal blow-hard, one of those guys who can explain everything and is never wrong.
<br />
<br />He believes that liberals and progressives don't know how to <a href="http://www.believermag.com/exclusive/lakoff/">frame</a> the national debate. He's so sure of himself that it never occurs to him that maybe the so-called conservatives are winning because they're right about something more fundamental than "framing".  Human beings are genetically programmed for what Steven Pinker calls the Tragic View, and conservatives get it but liberals don't.
