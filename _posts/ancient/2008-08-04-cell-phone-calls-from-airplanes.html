<p>A very smart, well-read, highly-educated friend of mine is convinced that the "standard explanation" for 9/11 is a hoax.&nbsp; As one proof, he points out that you can't make a mobile phone call from an airplane in flight, like supposedly the passengers&nbsp; of <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/03/911-movies.html">United 93</a> on Flight 93 did before the plane crashed in Pennsylvania.&nbsp; That famous "let's roll" from heroic passenger Tom Burnett?&nbsp;&nbsp; Never happened, he says.</p> <p>So in the interest of debunking the conspiracy theory, I risked the ire of the flight attendants during my plane ride this weekend, turning on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sprague/archive/2008/06/18/my-new-tilt.aspx">my AT&amp;T Tilt</a> in order to test the signal strength.&nbsp; I figured I'd call my friend from the plane, maybe leave him a ha-ha-guess-where-i'm-calling-you-from message on his answering machine.&nbsp; Yeah, yeah, I know they ban cell phones out of fear that they'll interfere with "sensitive communications equipment", but <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/1008297/">the New York Times</a> says there's no evidence for that, and my experiment was for a good cause.</p> <p>But guess what? It didn't work.&nbsp; Try as I might, I was completely unable to get a signal.&nbsp; It just wasn't there.&nbsp; Only as the plane was on its final descent, not more than 5,000 feet from the ground, did the signal strength become strong enough to detect.</p> <p>So what does this mean?&nbsp; I can think of a few possible explanations:&nbsp; </p> <ul> <li>The planes flew much lower than cruising altitude, at least when the calls were made.</li> <li>The passengers on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93">Flight 93</a> didn't use cell phones -- they used those in-flight GTE Airphones.</li> <li>Passengers were using much older, analog phones that have more signal strength and work on a different technology that maybe reaches the ground better.</li></ul> <p>What do you think?&nbsp; I'm not a conspiracy theorist, so those are the only explanations I'll suggest, but I admit it does make me curious.&nbsp; Have you ever tried successfully to make a phone call from a plane?</p>
