Put any photo or design you like. Might be cute for a child's birthday party, for example, or just a fun activity for a rainy day.<br /><br />Cost is $2/sheet for the transfers, or maybe $5 total including the shirt (which you can get at Target for super-cheap these days).<br /><br /><img src="http://www.makezine.com/blog/123562345_618646fe2f.jpg" />
