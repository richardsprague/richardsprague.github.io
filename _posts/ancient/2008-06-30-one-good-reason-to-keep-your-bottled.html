<p>Today's <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2008024882_water30.html">Seattle Times describes bottled water</a> and mentions that many of the the nation's mayors are suggesting we use tap water instead.</p> <p>But missing from the discussion is the one difference between bottled and tap water that might matter: tap water contains fluoride (at least here in Seattle and Mercer Island).&nbsp; Adults with healthy teeth don't need fluoride, and young kids can get it plenty of other ways.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=second-thoughts-on-fluoride">Scientific American</a> and others point out that many of us get too much, mostly thanks to tap water.</p> <p>I just checked with Aquafina (and I'm sure the other mainstream waters are similar): they don't contain fluoride.</p> <p>So my advice to anyone in government who wants to force us to give up bottled water:&nbsp; <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/01/take-flouride-out-of-our-water.html">turn off the fluoride</a> in the tap water first.</p>
