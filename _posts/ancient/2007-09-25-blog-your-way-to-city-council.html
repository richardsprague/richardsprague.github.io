<p><a href="http://www.electbrianseitz.com/">Brian Seitz</a> is a Microsoft employee who happens to be running for a seat on the&nbsp;Redmond City Council.&nbsp; I don't know anything about him, but if I lived in Redmond I'd definitely be following <a href="http://electbrianseitz.blogspot.com/">his blog</a>.&nbsp; He updates it regularly, so if you read it you come away feeling like you have a good sense of who he is and what he's trying to accomplish. Brian gives <a href="http://electbrianseitz.blogspot.com/2007/09/municipal-league-candidate-forum-on.html">immediate feedback about each event</a> he attends, <a href="http://electbrianseitz.blogspot.com/2007/08/issuing-my-own-correction-on-behalf-of.html">tells his side of the story</a> when the press makes a mistake, and even posts <a href="http://electbrianseitz.blogspot.com/2007/09/municipal-league-candidate-forum-on.html">Youtube outtakes</a> of himself.</p> <p>But here on Mercer Island,&nbsp;we've got nothing but ugly campaign signs and&nbsp;boring web sites.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.pattidarling.com/">Patti Darling's site</a>&nbsp;is an ugly single page&nbsp;that was apparently designed using&nbsp;the 1930 edition of Microsoft Word (slow!)&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.maureenjudge.com/">Maureen Judge</a> hasn't updated hers in&nbsp;over a&nbsp;month.&nbsp; Where's <a href="http://www.voteforcero.org/">Mike Cero</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://www.electbruce.org/">Bruce Basset</a>? Are they still running?</p> <p>So far none of our candidates offer an easy way to keep up with how their campaigns are progressing.&nbsp; What's with that?&nbsp; Are they expecting me to do all their blogging for them?&nbsp;</p>
