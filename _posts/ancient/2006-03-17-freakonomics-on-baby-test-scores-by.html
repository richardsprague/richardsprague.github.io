Cheers to <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/2006/03/13/new-evidence-on-racial-test-score-gaps/">FREAKONOMICS BLOG Â» New evidence on racial test score gaps</a> for stepping into a controversial, but vital question at the heart of genetics. We know that test scores vary by race among adults, and that a statistically significant variance shows up early.  Is environment responsible; is it innate? Even if you insist that "IQ" is not a relevant measure, please explain why there would be a difference.  If it's upbringing, then the younger you are, the lower the difference, right?<br /><br />So they studied a large data set of cognitive tests given to 8-12 month old babies and <a href="http://post.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/papers/fryer_levitt_ecls_babies.pdf">published a paper </a>last month with the results.  Answer: they couldn't find a difference between black and white babies, but they did see very slightly lower scores for Asians.
