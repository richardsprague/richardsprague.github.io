Malcolm Gladwell writes about <a href="http://www.gladwell.com/2004/2004_09_06_a_ketchup.html">ketchup.</a>  How come there aren't any gourmet versions, like we get with mustard or spaghetti sauce?
<br />
<br />Answer: Heinz ketchup is "high amplitude", with a broad appeal across all your senses, and it's associated with the broad, good tastes learned early in life. You can change it, maybe even make it taste better, but then it's not ketchup--it's sauce.
<br />
<br />I don't quite buy this argument. I bet I would try a good gourmet ketchup if it existed.
