<p>When, in the near future, robots can reliably move people and stuff, our lives will change in more ways than just the obvious “Now I don’t have to drive”.  Here’s my partial list of some other ways the world will be different:</p><ul><li>Employment: many occupations will cease to exist (cab drivers, truck drivers)</li><li>Car ownership: why bother owning a car if you can reliably summon one to/from wherever you want to be</li><li>Mass transit: big transportation projects (light rail, monorail, high speed rail) won’t make as much sense.</li><ul><li>underground tunnels can turn into highways.</li><li>Why build that big rail project, when caravans of cars can be more efficient?</li></ul><li>Parking: why waste space — the car can drive away when you don’t need it.</li><ul><li>Garages: if you don’t own car (or as many of them), then why waste space that way?</li><li>Cities can be even more dense. Even a place like Manhattan, which is already pretty compact, can lose its area devoted to parking.</li><li>Robot cars can stack themselves to be even more efficient at parking</li></ul><li>Fewer fatalities: the number of driving deaths will plummet, becoming an insignificant cause of death.</li><li>Car design changes</li><ul><li>If there are fewer collisions, then why not let up on some of the safety features?  (e.g. why make people face forward in the car instead of facing each other?)</li><ul><li>Do we need seat belts?</li></ul><li>Do we need cars made of metal exteriors?  Can we make a wider view, perhaps lots more glass</li></ul></ul><p>This is just the beginning. Unfortunately, the most substantive changes will take at least a generation to work themselves through the system, so it will be my grandchildren who really get the brunt of this.</p>
