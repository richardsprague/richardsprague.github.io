<p>Jason pointed me to a NY Times article from last week about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/23/dining/23coff.html?ex=1358830800&amp;en=bbab081c8b49ac8b&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink">high-end coffee machines</a>, including the siphon pot from Japan.&nbsp; Also see a <a href="http://laughingsquid.com/blue-bottle-cafe-opens-features-20k-siphon-bar-coffee-machine/">much more detailed</a> article at LaughingSquid.</p> <p><img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2008/01/22/dining/23blu.03.jpg"> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p>Although they give a nice look at Clover Coffee (of course!), the article fails to mention <a href="http://www.trabantcoffee.com/">Trabant</a>, which I think is the <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/11/clover-coffee.html">best place for brewed coffee</a>.
