<p>An SFGate blog, <a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/techchron/2013/11/25/fda-demands-23andme-halt-marketing-dna-tests/">supports</a> the FDA’s decision to <strike>prevent informed consumers&nbsp;&nbsp; from having our genes sequenced</strike> halt the marketing of 23andme:</p> <blockquote> <p>Silicon Valley whines any time regulators bog down their ability to “<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/19/why-zuckerberg-thinks-government-should-not-move-fast-and-break-things/">move fast and break things</a>.” But as a society, we’re far better off when a neutral party that isn’t in the business of selling a medical product takes steps to ensure it does more good than harm.</p></blockquote> <p>Nobody disagrees about the importance of neutral parties ensuring that products do more good than harm. But isn’t that precisely the purpose of SFGate, the rest of the media, and for that matter, the entire education system? We are surrounded by neutral parties giving their opinions about every product and service we buy. That’s one of the many great benefits of a free society.</p> <p>The FDA, like any other group of experts, is <a href="http://www.drugwatch.com/vioxx/recall/">often wrong</a>.&nbsp; What makes them so special that they, and only they, should be allowed to decide what kind of information an intelligent American is allowed to have? Can’t I make up my own mind?</p>
