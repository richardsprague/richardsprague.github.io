<p>We visited my favorite Mercer Island Japanese place, Yuzen, again last night.&nbsp; I was happy to see a much larger crowd than on our <a href="http://richardsprague.blogspot.com/2006/12/most-authentic-japanese-on-mercer.html">first visit.</a>&nbsp; As proof of how good it is, I see that it's been favorably reviewed in <a href="http://66.223.125.67/">JungleCity</a> (a Japanese language web site serving expat JPs in Seattle), and in fact there were Japanese-speaking guests at the table next to us.</p> <p>Incidentally, the restaurant is located in the Mercer Village Shopping Plaza, which was completed by <a href="http://www.eastsidebusiness.com/0906/ebSeptember2006web.pdf">Express Construction at a total cost of $1.74M</a> last Fall.&nbsp; The building was designed by Paul Franks Architecture. Apparently these are the same people who did that big shopping area at SeaTac, among others.&nbsp; </p>
