<a href="http://myradiotime.com/recorder-what-is.aspx">Radio Time: Recorder Software</a> is well-reviewed by Wired and CoolTools.  I've been using Replay-Radio instead, but I should check this out as well.
<br />
<br /><ul>
<br /><li>Cons compared to Replay-Radio: $40/yr subscription fee.</li>
<br /><li>Pro: much better guide, more professional-looking site.</li></ul>
