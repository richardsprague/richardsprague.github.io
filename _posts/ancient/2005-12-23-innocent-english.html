<a href="http://www.innocentenglish.com/church-bulletin-mistakes.html">Innocent English </a>has a hillarious collection of mistakes found in church bulletins. Some of these are absolutely butt-gusting:
<br />
<br />The Fasting & Prayer Conference includes meals. The sermon this morning: "Jesus Walks on the Water." The sermon tonight:  "Searching for Jesus." 
<br />
<br />The peacemaking meeting scheduled for today has been canceled due to a conflict. 
<br />
<br />For those of you who have children and don't know it, we have a nursery downstairs
<br />
<br />At the evening service tonight, the sermon topic will be "What Is Hell?" Come early and listen to our 
<br />choir practice.
