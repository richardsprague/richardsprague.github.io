<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;">Kevin Kelly asked&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #042eee; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;"><u>via Twitter</u></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;for people to offer, in 100 words, their vision for the future. Today he published the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #042eee; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;"><u>first 23 responses</u></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;">.&nbsp;I don’t have time right now to write my own short response, but here’s what I’m thinking:</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;">In the future, everyone can choose and run their own private empire, commanding vast dominions of robotic serfs to do their bidding. Like emperors throughout history, some will devote themselves to travel and exploration, some to science, some to the arts. Each dabbles more or else in everything — there’s an empire to run, after all — &nbsp;but ultimately they tend to specialize into a dynasty that is noteworthy for <i>something, </i>and that’s what you’ll be able to do.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;">Imagine if your ability to create or do anything was not constrained by your mastery of technique — computers can do that for you — but rather by your ability to imagine and then precisely articulate what you want instantiated.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;">You conceptualize something: a new product or service, perhaps, or a creative work like a novel or song. Imagine that the creation of that work is limited, not by your ability to build it yourself, but by your ability to describe it, or — perhaps —&nbsp;<i>identify&nbsp;</i>it. &nbsp;"I’m not sure what I’m building, but I’ll know when I’m done.”</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;">A lot of my ideas start out with “it’s kind of like X, only a little Y-er”. In the future, my robot minions will clamor for every clue I give them about my idea, offer proposed variations, then dutifully attempt to implement every &nbsp;detail.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;">Computer graphics pioneer Alvy Ray Smith used to say&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #042eee; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;"><u>“Reality is 80 million polygons”</u></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;">, and when machines can routinely give that to us, the ability to spend money on the physical world will matter less; &nbsp;living and acting in the virtual world will matter more. When anyone can build a virtual empire, stocked with whatever science, art, products, — anything imaginable — then the value of “stuff” from the real world will change. The responses to Kevin Kelly’s question that involve “stuff” — environment, energy, health — that could all happen, but happen differently in each private, virtual empire.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;">It gets more interesting because we can each share bits and pieces of our empires. I can even take your empire and pretend it’s my own! In fact, the currency that will matter most — as it did to ancient emperors — will be the attention and respect of fellow empires.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;">There’ll be a real world too, of course, and it’ll be much cleaner and wilder than it’s been in thousands of years. Physical property will have some value, but owning beachfront property or a private jet won’t have the relative prestige they did before everyone could get the bio-identical experience for free. Better to spend the land’s scarce resources on stuff to make the virtual world better: server farms, chip factories, biosensors.</span><div><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;">That’s the basic idea, but every day that future gets closer.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iknARmTx9rE/UKvcjsWHINI/AAAAAAACk4g/19idQ9r09-o/s1600/IMG_8498.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iknARmTx9rE/UKvcjsWHINI/AAAAAAACk4g/19idQ9r09-o/s1600/IMG_8498.JPG" height="240" width="320" /></a></div></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 13px;"></span><br /><div class="markdown-here-wrapper" data-md-url="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=8203221#editor/target=post;postID=5374155866432445294"><div style="font-size: 0em; height: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" title="MDH:PHA+PGJyPjwvcD4=">​</div></div></div>
