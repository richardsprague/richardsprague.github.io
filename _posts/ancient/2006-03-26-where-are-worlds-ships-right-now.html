<a href="http://www.sailwx.info/shiptrack/shiplocations.phtml">Ship locations</a> is a site that tracks, in real time, the location of all the world's commercial ships. It lets you immediately see a map of, say, all the ships about to dock at the Port of Seattle.<br /><br />For example, the Queen Mary 2 is currently near the tip of South America.<br /><br /><img src="http://static.flickr.com/42/118448891_ed49bd5cfe.jpg?v=0" />
