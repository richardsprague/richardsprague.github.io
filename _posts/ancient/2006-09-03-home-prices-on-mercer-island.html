<p>Today's Seattle Times has a front-page article predicting that <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003241541_appreciation03.html">home prices nationwide are going to fall.</a> They quote from PMI Mortgage Insurance calculations that show a 50% or greater likelihood of housing price drops for Boston, San Francisco, and San Jose, in contrast with Seattle where the risk of falling prices is only 11%.</p> <p><img src="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/ABPub/2006/09/02/2003241395.gif"> </p> <p>But who cares about averages? What matters to you is how your own neighborhood is doing. The online edition of the paper offers a more detailed breakdown that shows</p> <ul> <li>Mercer Island is #28 (out of 108 neighborhoods) for 5-year price appreciation.&nbsp; We're 10.8% (vs. 15.7% for #1-ranked Medina).</li> <li>Median home price on Mercer Island is $825K,&nbsp;putting&nbsp;us&nbsp;#3 in the region, behind Madison Park ($869K) and Medina ($1.14M).</li> <li>Price per square food, we're #9 ($332), well behind Madison Park ($408), Medina ($394), Queen Anne ($359) and others in North Seattle.</li> <li>Appreciation in 2004-2005, we're ranked #27 (18.2% -- same as Medina), behind super-hot places like Southpark (27.2%), West Seattle (22%), or Green Lake (19.4%), all of which are much more affordable of course.&nbsp; </li></ul> <p>The bottom line is that long-term I still think Mercer Island is about as protected pricewise as you can get. It's an island, with its own (strong) school system, with a fixed number of homes and residents.&nbsp; People will always want to live here, making home prices about as secure as they can get.</p>
