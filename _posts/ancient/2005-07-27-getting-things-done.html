Omar Shahine is a Microsoft blogger who posts a summary of how he improved his personal productivity. Of course personal attempts to organize yourself usually work for a few days or weeks and then peter out, but it's interesting to read his results of <a href="http://www.shahine.com/omar/GettingThingsDone2MonthsLater.aspx">shahine.com/omar/ - Getting Things Done 2 months later</a>
<br />
<br />He uses the David Allen techniques that were reviewed in Atlantic Monthly last year.
