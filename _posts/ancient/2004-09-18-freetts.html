I've been looking into text-to-speech lately, and saw this:<a href="http://freetts.sourceforge.net/docs/index.php">FreeTTS 1.2beta2 - A speech synthesizer written entirely in the Java(TM) programming language</a>
<br />
<br />If you have the JVM installed, just click on the .WAV icons on the left to hear some samples.  Very good quality.
