<p><a title="Cirque Du Soleil" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2465010137/"><img alt="Cirque Du Soleil" src="http://static.flickr.com/2322/2465010137_9e6f945bb0.jpg" border="0"></a></p> <p>This weekend we took the kids to <a href="http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/corteo/tickets/seattle.htm?sa_campaign=internal_ads/dropdown/Seattle/corteo">Cirque Du Soleil</a>, which is showing till June 1st in Redmond's Marymoor park.&nbsp; I must say, although I've been many times before (including once in Tokyo), I hate these things.&nbsp; The acrobats are extremely talented, I grant you, but I find it hard to watch them without a tinge of pain for myself thinking how awful it would feel to twist my body that way.</p> <p>It was pretty hard getting in to the event, with all the cars coming off 520 on that little exit.&nbsp; If you go on a weekend, I'd suggest coming from the other direction.&nbsp; Exit instead at 40th, the turn left on W Lake Sammamish parkway.&nbsp; There didn't seem to be any cars from that direction, and it's a right turn no stop into the park.&nbsp; Parking is $15.</p>
