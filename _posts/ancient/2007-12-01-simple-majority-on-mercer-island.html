Overall, Joint Resolution 4204 (aka Simple Majority) was approved by 5904 out of 8933 votes cast, or about 66% -- a landslide by any measure.<br /><br />In fact, there wasn't a single neighborhood on the Island that didn't approve the measure.  The narrowest victory (51%) came from one precinct near the high school.  Two neighborhoods tied for first place in approval percentage (74%):  one on Forest Ave and another near Lakeridge.<br /><br />How did your neighborhood do?<br /><br />My apologies for the poor and hard-to-read formatting of this post.  I didn't have time to put it in a nice easy-to-copy table.  Hopefully I can fix that when I post the precinct-by-precinct results for the City Council race.<br /><br />Meanwhile, does anybody have a GIS (or other map format) for Mercer Island voting precincts?  I'd love to put this data into map form to make it easier to read, but it would take too long to create it on my own.<br clear="all" />
