<p>I’m skeptical whenever mainstream consensus settles on an opinion about somebody or something, especially when it’s a subject that lends itself to very little first-hand, direct, up-close experience.&#160; For example, It’s pretty well-accepted, both by the general media and by people I hang out with, that our outgoing president is not the brightest bulb who ever inhabited the White House. But I’ve always been skeptical of such a quick-and-easy conclusion.&#160; You don’t get to be President by being a dummy.&#160; There’s enough competition out there to weed out the dim bulbs pretty quickly.&#160; </p>  <p>That’s why I was not as surprised as I bet you were to see that he reads about one serious book per week – far, far more than the general public, and probably more than you do.&#160; In fact, <a href="http://mssv.net/2008/12/28/the-long-decline-of-reading/" target="_blank">about 40% of Americans didn’t read a single book</a> last year.</p>  <p>According to a <a href="http://www.rove.com/articles/104" target="_blank">WSJ article by Bush friend Karl Rove</a>, the President read the following books in 2008:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>David Halberstam's &quot;The Coldest Winter,&quot; Rick Atkinson's &quot;Day of Battle,&quot; Hugh Thomas's &quot;Spanish Civil War,&quot; Stephen W. Sears's &quot;Gettysburg&quot; and David King's &quot;Vienna 1814.&quot; There's also plenty of biography -- including U.S. Grant's &quot;Personal Memoirs&quot;; Jon Meacham's &quot;American Lion&quot;; James M. McPherson's &quot;Tried by War: Abraham Lincoln as Commander in Chief&quot; and Jacobo Timerman's &quot;Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number.&quot;</p> </blockquote>  <p>He’s not one-sided, either.&#160; Look at this list of recent fiction:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Besides eight Travis McGee novels by John D. MacDonald, Mr. Bush tackled Michael Crichton's &quot;Next,&quot; Vince Flynn's &quot;Executive Power,&quot; Stephen Hunter's &quot;Point of Impact,&quot; and Albert Camus's &quot;The Stranger,&quot; among others.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Of course, just because somebody reads a lot more than you does not mean they are smart.&#160; But like almost everything else you think you know politics, or the economy, or famous people – things you know only indirectly (from what you read) and by word-of-mouth (from people you talk to) – the real story is far more complicated than you can imagine.</p>  <p>p.s. I wonder if this is one of the books he’s read:</p> <iframe style="width: 120px; height: 240px" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=richasprag-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=0471420069&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;m=amazon&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
