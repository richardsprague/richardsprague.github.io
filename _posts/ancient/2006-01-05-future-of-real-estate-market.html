<a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/2006/01/03/more-bad-news-for-real-estate-agents/">FREAKONOMICS BLOG ï¿½ More Bad News for Real Estate Agents</a> mentions the case of Madison, Wisconsin, where recently a critical mass of people have started selling their own homes, enough that now the Realtors have to pay attention.<br /><br />This will ultimately spread nationwide until all homes are old on a fixed cost basis, with fewer agents handling more transactions. <br /><br />The same thing applies to every business that today uses percentage-based commisions to do something that is essentially a fixed amount of work.  Watch out financial planners!
