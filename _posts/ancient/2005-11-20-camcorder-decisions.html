<br />The Panasonic PV GS400 is <a href="http://www.camcorderinfo.com/content/Panasonic-PV-GS400-Camcorder-Review.htm">reviewed as all-around better than my old DV953</a>.  lowest price = $959.59<br /><img src=http://www.camcorderinfo.com/images/upload/Panasonic-PV-GS400_vanity.jpg><br /><p><br /><a href="http://www.camcorderinfo.com/content/Sony-DCR-PC350-Camcorder-Review.htm">Sony DCR-PC350</a> goes for $789.<br /><img src=http://www.camcorderinfo.com/images/upload/Sony-DCR-PC350_vanity.jpg><br /><p><br />Conclusion from CamcorderInfo.com:<br /><blockquote>The Panasonic PV-GS400 beats the Sony DCR-PC350 in my mind. While the camcorders are tied on video quality, with nearly identical reproduction, the PV-GS400 slightly beats out the Sony on low light performance. The Panasonic offers superior manual control, handling, and options. While I would pick the Panasonic over the Sony, I really should note that they virtually tie each other when it comes to performance. If you are a point-and-shoot user, and you don't prize manual control and want a camcorder that's easy to use, the Sony DCR-PC350 is a much better choice. </blockquote><br /><br /><br />Consider this HD camera:<br /><a href="http://www.camcorderinfo.com/content/Sony-HCR-HC1-Review.htm">Sony HDR HC1</a> for $1439.95<br /><img src=http://www.camcorderinfo.com/images/upload/Image/Sony/Sony%20HDR-HC1/Sony-HDR-HC1_vanity(1).jpg><br />Boy I'd love to get that one, but HD still suffers from several problems: you need $13 tapes to avoid framedropping, and Pinnacle doesn't support the HDV editing format. I can probably upgrade to HD-capable software, but you still can't burn to a disc.<br /><br />
