Adolph Hilter&rsquo;s entire image was built on invincibility, strength, complete lack of tolerance for weakness; what happened when he faced defeat?<br /><br />Downfall is a movie based on the recollections of Hitler&rsquo;s personal secretary, a young woman who was at his side during the war and right to the end in his Berlin bunker. She remembers him as an inscrutable, a man who could be privately very gentle, forgiving, and kind, but in public reverts to "The FÃ¼hrer", an unchallengeable, unsympathetic, unforgiving tyrant intolerant of failure. When his generals lose and must face their inevitable self-destruction, he calls them traitors, humiliating them in front of the survivors, yet when she through nervousness makes a typing mistake he calmly and gently encourages her to start over.<br /><br />The others in his coterie face the inevitable in different ways. Many of the adjutants spend their final days in drunken stupor, laughing and telling jokes among themselves (&#8220;Berlin has been turned into warehouses. Everyone is running around saying &lsquo;where&rsquo;s my house?&#8221;). Frau Goebbels, loyal wife of the Nazi propagandist, gently kills her children in their sleep because &#8220;I can&rsquo;t let them grow up in a world without National Socialism&#8221;. Eva Braun has a happy, joyful disposition throughout, insisting on good food and drink, forcing reluctant soldiers to dance with her even as the bombs fall.<br /><br />Fifty years later we automatically think failure when we remember Hitler, but for the people who surrounded him in those final days&#8212;people who had grown up assuming they were part of something that would last a thousand years&#8212;there was some terrible soul-searching and a real lesson in humility. I can't help thinking that some of the same lessons must have been faced by Saddam's loyalists in their final days too.
