<p>The Seattle area enjoyed a rare sunny day on Saturday, so what better way to spend it than at a chess tournament. </p> <p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2256/2095756233_e0dd29ff8b.jpg?v=0"> </p> <p>Thinking I would have more time to catch up on stuff, I brought my laptop, but there were too many interesting people there and I ended up talking the whole time with people like <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/11/school-board-blogger.html">Janet Frohmayer</a>, who told me more about her blog, and Ken Glass (the emcee) and several parents who are interested in <a href="http://www.wheresthemath.com/">improving the math curriculum</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; So much to post, so little time...&nbsp; There's a lot happening on Mercer Island, and I wish we could get a whole community of blog posters so we can share the load of getting more people involved.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
