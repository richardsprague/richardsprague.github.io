Edge hosts a debate on <a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/debate05/debate05_index.html#p1">THE SCIENCE OF GENDER AND SCIENCE</a> between Steven Pinker and Elizabeth Spelke, a Harvard psychologist who has been named one of America's Best in Science and Medicine.
<br />
<br />Well worth reading, because both scientists are given time to carefully explain their positions, along with PowerPoint slides that you can see on the web.
