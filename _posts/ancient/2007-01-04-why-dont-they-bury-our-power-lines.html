<p>After last month's awful storm, many of us wonder why the power lines are above ground.&nbsp; When you lose power for 5 days like we did, and you multiply that by the population of Mercer Island, that's a lot of lost productivity that could have been avoided if the lines hadn't blown down.</p> <p>Here's a <a href="http://www.eei.org/industry_issues/energy_infrastructure/distribution/UndergroundReport.pdf">thorough report</a> by the Edison Electric Institute that answers the question:</p> <ul> <li>Underground lines cost 10 times as much and, even when you take into account the lost productivity when there's a power failure, the benefits only cover 38% of the costs.</li> <li>It may be worthwhile for aesthetic reasons, and who knows, maybe Mercer Island property values would go up, but our power rates would go up a lot as well: perhaps 80 to 125 percent.</li></ul> <p>I say forget it.</p> <p>(thanks to <a href="http://chuckop.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!2ABA97B471D34779!639.entry">Chuck</a> for the pointer)</p>
