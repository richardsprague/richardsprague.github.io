<br />We just bought a new digital cordless phone + answering machine, the Panasonic KX-TG2357 at CostCo for $100. Ask me in a few weeks what I really think, but so far it seems to work great.<p><br /><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00020KZTO.01._SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg" title="" border="0"><br /><p><br />It has talking CallerID, with some type of letter-to-sound rules that attempt to pronounce the incoming names. The rules don't work very well: for example "Microsoft Corp" is pronounced "Mick-ROW-suft C-O-R-P". The CallerIQ feature (also known as http://www.openLCR.com) appears to be a rip-off: pay a monthly fee of $10 or so to a company that promises to give your phone some cool updates like personalized weather or ring tones. I'm not sure how it works, but for that money I don't intend to find out.<br /><p><br />I may switch to Vonage for phone service one of these days, and I'm not sure what that will do to the features. One <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3DAS42VRO66SN/002-8731579-4150440">Amazon reviewer </a>says that he bought it for VOIP purposes but turned out that it wasn't necessary. I'm not sure what that means.<br />
