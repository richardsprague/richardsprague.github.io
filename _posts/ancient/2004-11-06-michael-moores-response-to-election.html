Michael Moore has posted <a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/">17 Reasons Not to Slit Your Wrists</a>, and once again the Blogosphere fights back with a <a href="http://www.drumwaster.com/archives/001649.html">point-by-point rebuttal</a>.
<br />
<br />One of the classic Moore misleading statements is about Kerry getting more votes than Reagan. Yes, technically true (55M for Kerry, 54M for Reagan in 1984), but doesn't take into account the 20 years of population growth.  Comparing electorate sizes, Reagan got today's equivalent of 67M votes.
<br />
<br />John Cross points out that, as a percentage, Kerry did worse than the following presidential losers:
<br />
<br />Richard Nixon (1960)
<br />Gerald Ford (1976)
<br />Winfield Hancock (1880)
<br />James Blaine (1884)
<br />
<br />
