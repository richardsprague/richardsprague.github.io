<p>This book came <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130925133311-291225-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-had-his-top-execs-read-these-three-books">recommended</a> by none other than Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and he’s right: it’s one of the better business books I’ve ever read. Written in a breezy, dialog style, it reads as much like a novel as a how-to book. </p> <p>The “goal” in the title refers to the fundamental purpose of any business: Turn a net profit, with high ROI, while maintaining cash flow. How you do that: reduce operational expense and reduce inventory while simultaneously increasing throughput.</p> <p>These principles are generalizable to any situation where you want to be more efficient, and the author suggests a “theory of constraints” based on a set of “five focusing steps” to help you do this:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Identify the system’s constraints</strong> (aka bottlenecks) that prevent the organization from obtaining more of the goal in a unit of time.</li> <li><strong>Decide how to exploit the constraints</strong> to get more out of them.</li> <li>Subordinate everything, <strong>realign the entire organization as necessary</strong> to support the decision above.</li> <li><strong>Elevate the system constraints</strong>, making any other major decisions necessary to increase the capacity at the constraint (bottleneck)</li> <li>If in these steps, a constraint is broken, go back to step 1. Never allow a constraint to continue solely due to inertia.</li></ol> <p>Like most good theories, these ideas seem obvious – nearly trivial – when you finally notice them. I suspect the applications are more obvious in well-established systems than in situations where you’re building something new. But even then, it’s healthy advice to be aware of bottlenecks to manage your system as efficiently as possible</p> <p>I can see how they apply to the field I know best (software development), and I’m surprised I haven’t run into this book before.</p> <p><iframe style="height: 240px; width: 120px" marginheight="0" src="http://rcm-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=richasprag-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as4&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;ref=ss_til&amp;asins=0884271951" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
