<p>A friend, somebody I trust, says <a href="http://houseofpeanut.blogspot.com/2008/02/hush-little-baby-dont-say-word.html">she was intimidated by</a> a dentist, Softcare Dental, in Bellevue Washington. It's making her think twice now about posting reviews on the Internet.</p> <p>I say no way! Speak up! If you had a bad experience, say so. If you had a good experience, say so.</p> <p>I know nothing at all about this dentist, other than my friend's opinion and what I just read on the internet. I may be wrong.&nbsp; But I note that (most?) of the "good" reviews are suspicious.&nbsp; Posted the same day, by anonymous people who didn't post any other reviews.&nbsp; I don't believe them.&nbsp; I believe my friend.</p> <p>If&nbsp; this dentist wants to intimidate <em>me</em> for posting my concerns, she's welcome to <a href="mailto:richardsprague+dentist@gmail.com">email me</a> or <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/08/call-me.html">call me</a>.&nbsp; Meanwhile, there are just too many good dentists out there (like <a href="http://www.mercerparkdental.com/">Dr. Nadeem Merchant</a>, who I use) so why bother risking your teeth with Softcare Dental?</p> <p>By the way, I disagree with my friend on one thing:&nbsp; I prefer to post under my real name. &lt;insert counter-arguments here&gt;&nbsp; I know, I know, but the psychos will find you anyway and when they do, your transparency will be an asset.</p>
