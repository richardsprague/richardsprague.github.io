<p><img src="http://cdn.nflximg.com/us/boxshots/large/70044885.jpg"> </p> <p>I try to keep up with popular movies about Japan, so that explains why this is on my <a href="http://www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?movieid=70044885&amp;trkid=90529">Netflix queue</a>, but oh what a waste. Definitely do not pay to see this movie, and if absolutely forced to watch, be sure to put it on fast-forward the whole time. <p>It's basically a juvenile car-loving white trash movie about car-racing, where the hero finds himself plopped in Japan in the middle of a bunch of similarly car-loving derelicts. So many things about this comically unreal: as though unemployed Japanese punks have the money to blow on these cars, and yes they use their camera phones everywhere. But our hero has no need for their stupid computer gadgets. Just give him the raw power of a V8 engine and a hot chick and he's a man. Yeah, baby.</p>
