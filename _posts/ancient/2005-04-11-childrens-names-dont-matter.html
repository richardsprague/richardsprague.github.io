<a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2116449/">A study of people's names by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner</a> shows: "Today, more than 40 percent of the black girls born in California in a given year receive a name that not one of the roughly 100,000 baby white girls received that year. Even more remarkably, nearly 30 percent of the black girls are given a name that is unique among every baby, white and black, born that year in California."
