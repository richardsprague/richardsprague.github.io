<p>The frenzy over ever-higher oil prices is approaching a bubble, and I bet it is time to consider shorting energy prices. New substitutes will start emerging, people will conserve more, and oil will no longer be king. </p><p>Here&rsquo;s a summary from Slate&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2124905/?nav=fo">Today&rsquo;s Blogs (Monday, Aug 22, 2005)</a></p><blockquote><p>Levitt gets plenty of cheers from peak-oil skeptics. "I think I probably agree with Levitt that the big effect of peak oil will be to simply cut the fat &hellip; out of oil consumption," <a href="http://snarkmarket.com/blog/snarkives/briefly_noted/peak_oil_press/index.html" target="_blank">writes</a> <strong>Snarkmarket</strong>'s Robin Sloan. "This will probably not involve roaming bands of petro-pirates in wind-powered gun-skiffs." At <em>Reason</em>'s in-house blog <strong>Hit &amp; Run</strong>, Jesse Walker <a href="http://www.reason.com/hitandrun/2005/08/left_behind_the.shtml#010647" target="_blank">commends</a> Levitt's critique and compares peak oil hysteria to apocalyptic, <em>Left Behind</em> eschatology. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Not everybody pooh-poohs the article's alarmism. "[A]n excellent article. Well researched. Balanced. Thoughtful," <a href="http://tceconomist.blogspot.com/2005/08/breaking-point.html" target="_blank">praises</a> <strong>Cultural Economist</strong> Ronald R. Cooke. "Bravo." At blip.tv's <strong>Pokkari Blog</strong>, Mike stakes out a middle ground. "I think the market is already correcting, and that the introduction of alternative fuel vehicles will only accelerate," he <a href="http://www.pokkari.com/blog/2005/08/22/the-times-gets-tw0-fiskings/" target="_blank">writes</a>. "The electricity sector will compensate, too, and we'll end up using oil mostly for plastics."</p><p>Read <a href="http://technorati.com/search/www.nytimes.com/2005/08/21/magazine/21OIL.html" target="_blank">more</a> about the <em>Times</em> <em>Magazine</em> article; and <a href="http://technorati.com/search/peak%20oil" target="_blank">more</a> about peak oil.</p></blockquote>
