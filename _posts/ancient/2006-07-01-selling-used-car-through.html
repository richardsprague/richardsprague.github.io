<a href="http://www.caralternative.com/index.php">CarAlternative.com </a>sounds like an interesting service: you give them their car and they sell it at auction, giving you the proceeds minus a roughly 20% fee.<br /><img src="http://www.caralternative.com/images/common/logo.gif" /><br /><br />I saw them in a Google ad, but I'm unable to find any reference to them anywhere but their web site. Nothing shows up on Factiva, and an Internet search includes a page or so of listings that are mostly just the caralternative.com web site.<br /><br />If you have a car that doesn't run, and your only options are to donate it or junk it, this seems like an ideal system. But what about a person like me, with a perfectly good car that's not fetching what I see as a reasonable trade-in value at a new car dealer?  With caralternative.com, I'm at the mercy of the auction, with a completely unknown sales value.<br /><br />The site claims they have relationships with car wholesalers--presumably the same people that used car dealers use. <br /><br />Has anybody ever heard of these people?
