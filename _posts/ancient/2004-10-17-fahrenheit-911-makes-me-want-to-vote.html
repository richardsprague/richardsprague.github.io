Some friends lent us their DVD last night, and we finally watched the Michael Moore film to see what all the fuss is about.  
<br />
<br />Frankly, we were disappointed. It's so over-the-top slanted and biased that you leave feeling like "what's this guy's problem".
<br />
<br />I watched it with my laptop open to a web site documeting all the <a href="http://www.davidkopel.org/Terror/Fiftysix-Deceits-in-Fahrenheit-911.htm">mistakes</a> in the film.
<br />
<br />I respect bias as much as the next guy, but I left with the same feeling I get when listening to Rush Limbaugh: yes, lots of humorous slams on the other guy, but at the expense of really getting to the bottom of the issues.
<br />
<br />We concluded that the movie would have been a lot more effective in the hands of somebody like Oliver Stone, who would have made it far more subtle, and dangerous.
