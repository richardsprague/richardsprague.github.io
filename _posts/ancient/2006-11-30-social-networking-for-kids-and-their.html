<p>Two new venture-backed startups go after the stay-at-home market.</p> <p><a href="http://www.industriouskid.com/ar-20060615-siliconbeat.html">Industrious Kid</a>, founded by former execs at Ascend Communications, just got $6M in venture funding to start <a href="https://www.imbee.com/">Imbee</a>, a MySpace-type social networking thing for 8-year-olds (and above).&nbsp; At $40/year I just don't see it taking off, though.&nbsp; Any parent involved enough with their kids' internet use will be involved enough to chaperone them on MySpace for free.&nbsp; Why bother with less?</p> <p><img src="http://www.industriouskid.com/images/iklogo-std.gif"> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="http://www.clubmom.com/">Club Mom</a> wants to be a social networking site "for moms, by moms".</p> <p><img src="http://www.clubmom.com/img/skeleton/header/cmlogo_104x65.gif"> </p> <p>Again, I'm not sure what the market is.&nbsp; Everybody wants to create a "community", but rather than force people to come to <em>you</em>, I think the future is in aggregation -- let people go wherever they want, and <em>you</em> come to <em>them</em>. </p>
