<p>When my inlaws flew in and out last week it would have been nice to know about this site: <a href="http://www.flightstats.com">http://www.flightstats.com</a></p> <p><img src="https://www.flightstats.com/go/images/Header/flightstats_fly_smarter_logo.gif"> </p> <p>It's the flight arrival/departure stats site for all time.&nbsp; Not only does it show estimated time of arrival/departure (of course), it summarizes the weather info,&nbsp;and everything else known about that flight.&nbsp; What's its historical&nbsp;on-time arrival performance? Are there any other delays at&nbsp;that airport right now?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
