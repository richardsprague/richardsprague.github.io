<p>While browsing with my 10-year-old in the children's section of the Seattle Public Library today, I stumbled into <a href="http://www.stonesoup.com/">Stone Soup</a>, bimonthly literary magazine targeted at kids under age 13.&nbsp; It contains stories, poems, and book reviews written by kids.&nbsp;&nbsp;They pay $40 per published article, which would be a lot of money to a kid and quite an incentive to submit something. I guess it works, since they claim to get 250 submissions per week.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="http://www.stonesoup.com/imgs/covers/cover20073.jpg"></p>
