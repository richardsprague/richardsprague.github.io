I have a hard drive that failed last month. Nothing super important on it--it just has some old video .avi files that I can recreate if necessary. But it would save a lot of time if I could somehow retrieve it.
<br />
<br />So I called <a href="http://www.diskdoctors.com/">diskdoctors</a>, which has a office in Bellevue. They say it would be at least $500.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.a1bestcomputer.com/data_recovery.html">A1-Best Computer</a> in Seattle says they'll charge $60 for one hour of labor. If they get the data in one hour, that's all you pay.  They're open till 5pm on SAturdays (closed Sunday).
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.pcdrweb.com/">PC Doctor</a>, in Bellevue, charges $75
