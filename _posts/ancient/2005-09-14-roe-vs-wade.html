<p>Whenever something bad happens, blame it on George Bush.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s responsible. Whether in the U.S. or abroad, just remember: if it&rsquo;s bad, it&rsquo;s <em>his</em> fault.&nbsp; Keep repeating until all those morons who support him finally figure out that he is the worst thing that ever happened to the world, ever.  That's right, keep repeating: we're all morons! </p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p>Q: What does George Bush really think about Roe vs. Wade?&nbsp; </p><p>A: He doesn&rsquo;t really care how you get out of New Orleans&mdash;row or wade, either way, just go.</p></blockquote><p>(a friend sent me this joke, along with this image from <a href="http://politicalhumor.about.com/library/images/blbushfishingvacation.htm">Political Humor</a>. &ldquo;Bush&rsquo;s Vacation&rdquo;)</p><p><img alt="" src="http://z.about.com/d/politicalhumor/1/0/o/f/bush_vacation_fishing.jpg" border="0" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
