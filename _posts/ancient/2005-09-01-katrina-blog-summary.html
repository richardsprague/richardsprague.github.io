<br /><a href="http://wizbangblog.com/archives/006930.php">Wizbang</a> is a long summary of other blogs, most of them filed by locals.
<br />
<br />Bunch of <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/hurricanekatrina/">photos </a>on FlickR, interesting because they are all taken by amateurs, many of whom are roaming the city in ways the new media doesn't.
