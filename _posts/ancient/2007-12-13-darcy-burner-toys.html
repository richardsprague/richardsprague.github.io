<p><a href="http://www.darcyburner.com/">Darcy Burner</a>, Democratic contender for our district's congressional seat, is running a brilliant campaign <strike>gimmick</strike> appearance this week.&nbsp; Rather than give speeches or hold boring "meet the candidate" forums, she's holding free "<a href="http://www.darcyburner.com/news/releases/burner_campaign_to_offer_free_toxics_testing_of_toys_this_holiday_season/">toxic toy testing</a>s" at various public libraries throughout the area, including one on Mercer Island (Island Park Elementary School) on Saturday, December 15th from 6 - 8pm.</p> <p>I love this idea, which is straight out of <a href="http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/">Black Swan</a> theory: it exposes her to possibly extreme upsides with almost no downside risk.</p> <ul> <li>First, although very few (if any) toys -- other than those already recalled-- will test positive for lead,&nbsp; nobody will ever print a headline that reports a negative result.&nbsp; The only guaranteed campaign message that will make the papers is the <a href="http://www.mi-reporter.com/articles/2007/12/13/lifestyle/calendar/calendar.txt">one that's already been printed</a>.&nbsp; There is no danger of a headline like "Darcy Burner Fails to Find any Unsafe Toys" -- even if ultimately that's what happens.  <li>Second, there is a very small (but non-zero) chance that testing might reveal a new, hitherto undiscovered toy that should be recalled.&nbsp; Toy companies are extremely vigilant -- far more than any politician can be -- at protecting their brands from any perception whatsoever that their products might be unsafe.&nbsp; But the recent publicity over recalls, combined with parents' natural fear of any unknown risks regarding their children, makes us naturally feel better about actions like this.&nbsp; And who knows, maybe Darcy will get lucky.  <li>Finally, there are plenty of reasonable ways Darcy can manipulate the testing to her advantage.&nbsp; Just about anything (including the safest toy) has some naturally occurring level of toxins in it.&nbsp; Equipment with enough sensitivity will find those toxins, even though the levels are far, far below anything of risk to humans.&nbsp; And if you object that she is testing at unrealistic levels, she can always insist that the current standards are too lax.&nbsp; After all, do you really want to take a chance with your children?</li></ul> <p><strong>Here's my prediction:</strong> I bet she doesn't find a single unsafe toy (other than those already recalled).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, she'll find many objects with high amounts of lead -- especially among items that any informed adult will recognize as something you shouldn't eat, but nothing from name-brand toy makers.&nbsp; The prankster in me wants to show up with one of her campaign buttons (cracked open a bit to expose the lead paint) and test <em>that, </em>but otherwise the only toxins that will be uncovered will be, well, anger that the world is an unsafe place.</p> <p><em>Update</em>: Sure enough, she found <a href="http://www.darcyburner.com/blog/lead_article/burner_toy_testing_yields_troubling_results/#target">47 items (or 10% of the items tested) with lead levels</a> above 40ppm, considered to be excessive by the American Academy of Pediatrics.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her press release doesn't say whether any of the items were toys from name-brand makers, or newly discovered items that haven't already been recalled.&nbsp; Since such a finding would have been far more newsworthy, I suspect that means she failed to find anything that hasn't already been pulled from store shelves -- i.e., nothing that the Consumer Products Safety Commission hasn't already flagged.</p> <p><img height="272" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1081/741913314_a31df872d7.jpg?v=0" width="446"></p>
