Lawrence David, at Duke University, <a href="http://genomebiology.com/2014/15/7/R89">tracked two people’s microbes for a year</a>, offering a rare peek into how the makeup of the gut changes over time. Similar experiments have been performed by other people (e.g. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/07/the-measured-man/9018/?single_page=true">Larry Smarr</a>, ) but this is the first time I’ve seen this much detail. Armed with the iPhone app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tap-forms-lite-organizer-secure/id332203469?mt=8">Tap Forms</a>, the two subjects kept track of 300+ variables daily, including diet/exercise/mood, etc. &nbsp;(Yes, that’s pretty hard-core self-tracking, but they were chosen specifically because they were die-hard QSers). &nbsp;The whole paper is worth studying, but here are a few highlights:<br /><ul><li>Overall microbial gut ecology is pretty stable over time — it takes a lot to change the bugs inside you</li><li>Eating fiber has the biggest, fastest effect on the microbial profile</li><li>What doesn’t change your microbes: sleep, exercise, mood (surprisingly)</li><li>Saliva has little effect on gut bacteria (even though you swallow more than 1 liter of the stuff per day!)</li></ul>Especially interesting were the two times where there was a noticeable change in the ecology of the microbes. &nbsp;The first was when the person moved to Southeast Asia for several weeks in the middle of the experiment:<br /><img alt="Microbes Living Abroad" border="0" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-gsn4EteLCoE/U9WbxFwMMUI/AAAAAAAC4GA/PWGXUDuunr8/gb-2014-15-7-r89-1_pdf__1_page_.jpg?imgmax=800" height="507" style="float: center;" title="gb-2014-15-7-r89-1_pdf__1_page_.jpg" width="500" /><br /><br />and here's when one of the people got sick:<br /><img alt="Microbe makeup after an illness" border="0" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-l9JELYXayl4/U9Wb0P80GpI/AAAAAAAC4GI/xSVslM_AM4g/gb-2014-15-7-r89-1_pdf__1_page_.jpg?imgmax=800" height="501" style="float: center;" title="gb-2014-15-7-r89-1_pdf__1_page_.jpg" width="500" /><br />&nbsp;A little scary how permanently his gut bacteria were changed because of one sickness.<br />Very interesting experiment, and I look forward to being able to do the same thing on myself someday.<br /><br />
