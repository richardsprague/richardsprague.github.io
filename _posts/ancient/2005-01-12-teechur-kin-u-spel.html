<a href="http://www.soundpolitics.com/archives/003454.html">Sound Politics</a> and Douglas Jole notice this spelling mistake on the <a href="http://www.unionvoice.org/campaign/certify/gsue8i22755i7t">Washington Teacher's Union</a> web site:<br /><br /><font size=3>Certify Christine Gregoire! <br />Dear Union Member,<br />As you know, Christine Gregoire's <b>gubanatorial</b> election has already been certified by the Secretary of State. Tomorrow, the state legislature will also certify the election as fair and complete. </font><br /><br />To their credit, I'm sure the teacher's union is very busy fighting for higher quality education, often enduring great personal and job sacrifices on behalf of our children. "Gubernatorial" is not an easy word to spell under those circumstances. The concept of "margin of error" is probably not something they are required to teach, so no doubt a vote count that is <a href="http://richardsprague.blogspot.com/2005/01/wa-state-election-was-statistical-tie.html">99.9% accurate</a> sounds pretty good to them too.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
