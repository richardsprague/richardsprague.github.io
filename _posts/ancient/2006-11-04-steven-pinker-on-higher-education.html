Steven Pinker thinks Harvard's new curriculum could be tweaked a little: <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=515314">Less Faith, More Reason</a><br /><br />1. Adding an ethical tint to the study of science and technology misses the point that the pursuit of knowledge is a good thing in and of itself. "[S]cience courses should aim to be more than semester-long versions of “An Inconvenient Truth.” "<br />2. The "Reason and Faith" requirement is a U.S.-centric way to look at religion.  "It is an American anachronism, I think, in an era in which the rest of the West is moving beyond it. "
