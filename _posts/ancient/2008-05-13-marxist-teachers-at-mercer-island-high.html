<p>Oh dear, looks like I've seriously underestimated <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/12/mercer-island-schools-don-make-gold.html">the challenges facing Mercer Island schools</a>.&nbsp; Not only are we underfunded, but look at what <a href="http://gollygeeez.blogspot.com/2008/05/this-apple-didnt-fall-too-far-from-tree.html">one blogger uncovered about our community:</a></p> <blockquote> <p>The school Ann [Dunham, mother of Barack Obama] attended, Mercer Island High School, was a hotbed of pro-Marxist radical teachers. John Stenhouse, board member, told the <a href="http://en.metapedia.org/w/index.php?title=House_Un-American_Activities_Subcommittee&amp;action=edit">House Un-American Activities Subcommittee</a> that he had been a member of the <a href="http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_USA">Communist Party USA</a> and this school has a number of Marxists on it's staff. Two teachers at this school, Val Foubert and Jim Wichterman, both <a href="http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School">Frankfurt School</a> style <a href="http://en.metapedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marxists&amp;action=edit">Marxists</a>, taught a <a href="http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory">critical theory</a> curriculum to students which include d; rejection of societal norms, attacks on Christianity, the traditional family, and assigned readings by <a href="http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx">Karl Marx</a>. The hallway between Foubertâ€™s and Wichterman classrooms was sometimes called "anarchy ally."</p></blockquote> <p>The pieces are beginning to come together.&nbsp; Censorship of <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/03/inoffensive-fifth-grade-art.html">offensive art</a>, the <a href="http://blogs.misd.k12.wa.us/band-china-trip/">band's recent trip</a> to Communist China, <a href="http://mercerislandblogger.wordpress.com/2008/05/07/will-a-farmers-market-make-mercer-island-more-like-capitol-hill-and-fremont/">photos of Lenin on a new Mercer Island resident's blog</a>?&nbsp; Coincidence?&nbsp; or am I just drinking too much <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/08/raw-milk.html">raw milk</a>?</p>
