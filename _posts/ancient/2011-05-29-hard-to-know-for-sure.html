<p>I keep running into this problem of the limitations of knowledge. Today, a professor friend of mine reminded me how the one thing you take away from earning a PhD is how little you know of your field of study. We were discussing the old saying that after your first week in China you’ll feel like you could write a book about the place; after a year you’ll think you could write a magazine article; after a few years you give up writing anything.</p>  <p>The <a href="http://uselesstree.typepad.com/useless_tree/2011/05/understanding-china-or-not.html">Useless Tree Blog discusses</a> (via <a href="http://www.chinalawblog.com/2011/05/on_the_possibility_of_understanding_china.html">China Law Blog</a>) a <a href="http://www.scmp.com/portal/site/SCMP/menuitem.2af62ecb329d3d7733492d9253a0a0a0/?vgnextoid=0b1f7bc4b8adf210VgnVCM100000360a0a0aRCRD&amp;ss=China&amp;s=News">recent interview</a> with Chinese official Wang Qishan claiming that China is only understandable to insiders like himself, but my first thought is “what does it mean to <i>understand</i> in the first place.” Does anybody really know?</p>  <p>Then there’s <a href="http://norvig.com/chomsky.html">Peter Norvig’s excellent review</a> of a recent remark by Noam Chomsky dismissing the use of statistical techniques in linguistics. Chomsky apparently thinks real scientific understanding requires more than a statistical analysis of a bunch of data—you have to synthesize that knowledge, presumably into simpler, fundamental rules that describe the Universe. That’s super-hard, and except in Physics almost always turns out to be an approximation anyway.</p>  <p>This is just restating the problem identified by Hayek in <i><a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw1.html">The Use of Knowledge in Society</a> </i>and by countless others who reflect on the limitations of what we know.</p>  <p>Society gives too much credit to people who <em>appear </em>to know, but I think self-confidence is no substitute for understanding.<img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4114/4850518795_ee1f302519_d.jpg" width="461" height="344" /></p>
