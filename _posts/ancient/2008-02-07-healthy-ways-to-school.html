<p>There's a wonderful debate going on about <a href="http://ourmi.wikispaces.com/Healthy+Ways+to+School">school transportation at ourmi.wikispaces.com</a>, a community web site organized by new city council member <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/11/meeting-bruce-bassett-at-starbucks.html">Bruce Bassett</a>.&nbsp; Bruce and school board member John DeVleming discuss how and whether to promote getting kids to school via means other than cars, a debate that has additional new data to help understand the current situation.&nbsp;&nbsp; A classroom survey at Lakeridge Elementary School last month indicated that on most mornings, here's how Mercer Island kids get to school:</p> <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="160" border="1"> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top" width="105">Walked</td> <td valign="top" width="53">16%</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="108">Biked</td> <td valign="top" width="53">2%</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="110">Rode the bus</td> <td valign="top" width="53">39%</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="112">Rode in a car</td> <td valign="top" width="53">43%</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Note that these numbers are subject to some interpretation, since we don't know how many of the car riders were actually car pools of several kids riding together.&nbsp; And the kids who walk or biked are almost all from homes located adjacent to the school.&nbsp; <p><strong>I think John DeVleming wins this one, hands down.</strong>&nbsp; How do "we" as a society (<a href="http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_10_1_1_klein.pdf">whatever that means</a>), know that it's "better" for more kids to walk or bike to school?&nbsp; Bruce says it's better because: <ol> <li>Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions due in part to increasingly inactive lifestyles.  <li>An estimated 25% of morning traffic is parents driving their children to school.  <li>More cars on the street make neighborhoods seem less safe, discouraging walking and biking.  <li>Overcrowded school drop-off and pick-up areas bring pollution and traffic danger to the doorsteps of our schools.</li></ol> <p>The first argument doesn't apply to my family: my kids are not obese and they're not inactive.&nbsp; I'm not an expert on other families or other communities (maybe Bruce is?) so other than some speculation and/or personal opinions, I don't know how to tell whether encouraging walking will help or hurt "society". </p> <p>The second and third arguments don't apply to my family either, since I drive the kids to school on my way to work, so no gas or traffic would be saved by them taking the bus.</p> <p>The fourth argument is one where smart school policies can really have a positive impact--and already do.&nbsp; My elementary school has strict rules, enforced by volunteers each morning, to ensure exactly how cars may approach the school.&nbsp; And of course general speed limits (strictly enforced by a visible police presence) keep the area around schools much safer.</p> <p>Finally, let's imagine Bruce could get his dream situation enacted and a tree-lined footpath were created in my back yard, with happy, singing children dancing together on their way to school and back each day.&nbsp; My kids probably <em>still</em> would end up with me.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because we're in a hurry to get them to school and back again so they can go to their karate lessons, soccer games, and a host of other <em>active</em> lifestyle choices.&nbsp; I walked to school when I was a kid (and my grandparents walked to work) because we were all much poorer, with no other options.&nbsp; Thankfully, the world has progressed a long way since then.</p>
