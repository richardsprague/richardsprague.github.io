<p><a href="http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=012706B">TCS Daily - Stuck on 1968</a>:<br /><blockquote><p>"The Conventional Wisdom among well-educated liberals in 1968 included the<br />following: </p><ul><li>Anti-Communism was a greater menace than Communism.</li><li>The planet could not possibly support the population increases that would take<br />place by the end of the twentieth century. </li><li>Conservatives stood in the way of progress for minorities.</li><li>Government programs were the best way to lift people out of poverty. </li><li>What underdeveloped countries needed were large capital investments, financed by foreign aid from the rich countries. </li><li>Inflation was a cost-push phenomenon, requiring government intervention in<br />wage and price setting.</li></ul><p><br />The degree of confidence in these beliefs was so strong that liberals in 1968 came to the overriding conclusion that: Anyone who is not a liberal must be incorrigibly stupid."</p></blockquote>
