<a href="http://businessbookreview.com/">Business Book Review:</a> is another one of those book summary services, similar to the <a href="http://www.getabstract.com/">GetAbstract </a>one I get a work.<br /><img src="http://businessbookreview.com/images/bannerleft.gif" /><br /><br />Today's WSJ [subscription required] has a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB114351480028709733.html?mod=hps_us_editors_picks">summary</a> of the summarizers. Curiously, they don't mention GetAbstract. They also don't mention my favorite new site of all: <a href="http://www.safaribooksonline.com/">Safaribooksonline</a>, which gives you the full text online to zillions of (mostly technical) books.
