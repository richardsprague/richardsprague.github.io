It's not on this week's ballot, but finally <a href="http://richardsprague.blogspot.com/2005/11/ask-iraqis.html">somebody asked the Iraqis</a> what they think about the presence of coalition troops and whether or not the U.S. should leave immediately.  
<br />
<br />Most Americans (including me) would leave immediately if we could. But what do the Iraqis want?  According to <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1139829-2,00.html">this ABC/Time poll of 1700 Iraqis</a>, only 26% want the U.S. to leave immediately.  The vast majority "oppose the presence of coalition forces", but heck, what do you think they'd say?
<br />
<br />Also note that the vast majority (almost 3/4ths) think things are going "quite well" or "very well".  Since this is completely at odds with what most of us hear about Iraq, what do they know that we don't?
