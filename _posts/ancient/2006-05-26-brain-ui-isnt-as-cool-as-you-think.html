My buddy Paul pointed me to this week's NYTimes article about how <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/technology/AP-Honda-Robot.html?_r=3&oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&oref=slogin">Honda Says Brain Waves Control Robot </a>.  Somebody at their car labs has a demo of a person controlling a robot through brain waves.<br /><br />One of our employees is really into this stuff -- calls it BUI (Brain UI).  Ray Kuzweill takes it for granted that this will be a reality by the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sprague/archive/2005/10/12/480083.aspx">Singularity</a>, which is all set for 2045, although the brainwave stuff happens sooner, like in 10 or 20 years.<br /><br />I'm not convinced this is terribly interesting. Maybe it's nice to not have to physically interact with a computer, but you still have to think. Brainwaves are an unstructured mess until you focus them into a unified thought. But that's exactly what language is. Our vocal cords, hands, eyes -- they're extensions of our brain's thought-focusing machinery.  I bet you'd find that in most situations it's easier to simply do what you do right now: use speech or hand gestures.
