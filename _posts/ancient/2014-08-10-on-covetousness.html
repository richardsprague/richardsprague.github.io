The Ten Commandments are supposed to be a summary, directly from God, of the most basic moral code. Most of them are obvious “biggies”: &nbsp;Kill, Steal, Adultery, disobey parents, swear. &nbsp;A few of them deal with God (honor the Sabbath, don’t pray to anyone else, don’t make fun of his name). &nbsp;All of these are basically understandable -- do it and you harm somebody. &nbsp;Not good. But one of the Ten Commandments -- two, if you follow the Catholic numbering scheme ( different religious traditions number the Commandments differently) -- has nothing to do with actual harm to anyone else.&nbsp;In fact, the people around you could be violating this commandment right now and you’d never know it.<br /><br />Two of the Ten Commandments, devoted to nothing more than <i>thought</i>. Which commandment is that?<br /><br />Thou Shalt Not Covet.<br /><br />Okay, contrast this with, say, adultery, where you have a clear, obvious reason why it's a sin: &nbsp;a spouse is harmed, there is potential for paternity lawsuits, etc. I mean, I get that one. &nbsp;But an equally numbered commandment deals simply with coveting your neighbor’s spouse. &nbsp;Coveting? &nbsp;You mean, I’m not even supposed to imagine, in the privacy of my own mind, what it would be like to have my neighbor’s wife? &nbsp;And that’s right up there, commandment-wise, as adultery? Come on!<br /><br />This seems especially anomalous because you see covetousness all around us. &nbsp;Some people think a certain amount of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Gekko">greed is good</a>, depending on the circumstances. What is an interest in income inequality, for example, if a concern that the have-nots will become envious of the haves? Is Thomas Picketty endorsing covetousness? Or take the umbrage that people feel over racism or sexism or the other “hate-isms” — isn’t that also another form of covetousness? &nbsp;I covet your station in life. I covet your status.<br /><br />With the right circumstances that seems like a good thing: when I make others aware that they have more than I do, I help society treat everyone more fairly. &nbsp;&nbsp;If nobody ever coveted, there'd be no reason to change the situation, right?<br /><br />Help me, I'm confused.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
