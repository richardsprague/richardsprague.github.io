<p>Hillary <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/10/city-council-blogger.html">agrees with me</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>"We should even have a government blogging team where people in the agencies are constantly telling all of you, the taxpayers, the citizens of America, everything that's going on so that you have up-to-the-minute information about what your government is doing, so that you too can be informed, and hold the government accountable," Clinton said.</p></blockquote> <p>[quoted <a href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/01/clinton-chasing.html">in Wired</a>]</p> <p>But rather than push this on at the federal or even state level, where it will just become the job of professional PR people, I think this would be far more important and effective for local governments, where individual personalities matter more, and where direct feedback with individuals can be more effective.</p>
