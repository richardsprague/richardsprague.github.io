<p><img src="http://www.edibleseattle.net/images/home/name.gif"></p> <p> "I want farmers to be as famous as rock stars", says Jill Lightner, the editor of the new foodie quarterly, <a href="http://www.edibleseattle.net/">Edible Seattle</a>.&nbsp; As the grandson and son of Wisconsin farmers, this sounds like my kind of magazine!&nbsp; So I rushed over to Metropolitan Market near the Space Needle, as <a href="http://seattlest.com/2008/04/18/seattle_is_edib.php">soon as I heard</a> it was on the newsstands.&nbsp; (<a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004356359_webedible17.html?syndication=rss">They don't yet have it</a> at Whole Foods or PCC, at least when I called this weekend).</p> <p>They focus on locally grown food, which of course always comes down to farmers like the people behind <a href="http://www.woolypigs.com/">wooly pigs</a> (featured in the first issue), or chickens (how to raise them in your back yard!). I can't wait till they do something with dairy farms and <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/08/raw-milk.html">raw milk</a> (hey maybe they could get my 90-year-old grandma to tell them how to milk a cow by hand--the way she showed me when I was a kid). It appears that most of the contributors have <a href="http://www.edibleseattle.net/resources.html">web pages and blogs</a>, making it easy to follow up if you see something really interesting.</p> <p>The $5 price tag is worth it for the excellent summaries of the local food calendar (which foods are in season and when), the farmers markets (they list <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/01/mercer-island-farmers-market.html">Mercer Island's</a> too), and various gems like the <a href="http://www.nwsource.com/ae/scr/edb_vd.cfm?c=r&amp;ven=29364&amp;s=nws">Tofu Restaurant</a> on Jackson I didn't know sells its own tofu fresh every day.&nbsp; (Unfortunately, an apparent typo in the magazine didn't list the shop's name, so I'll have to try calling or visiting them, maybe when I'm near there next Saturday).&nbsp; I liked the "news bites" summary, which among other things was the first place I'd heard that distillery laws are changing this year, enabling smaller producers to get into the business.</p> <p>The publisher has been putting out regional food magazines for a long time in other parts of the country for a long time.&nbsp; I think I first heard about them in San Francisco, or maybe it was Portland, so it's nice they finally have one for us too.</p>
