<p>When the owner of a stolen or found item can't be located, the Mercer Island police department sells it at <a href="http://www.propertyroom.com">http://www.propertyroom.com</a> </p> <p>You can also register your items at <a href="http://www.stealitback.com.&nbsp;">http://www.stealitback.com.&nbsp;</a>If they are ever found by the police, you'll get them back for free.</p> <p><img src="http://pics1.edeal.com/images/p2/wl/stealitback/SIBLogoHP.jpg"> </p> <p>Apparently Mercer Island was the first in Washington State to join this service.</p>
