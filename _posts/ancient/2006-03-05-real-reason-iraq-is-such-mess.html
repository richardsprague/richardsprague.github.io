In <a href="http://www.isteve.com/cousin_marriage_conundrum.htm">"Best Science &amp; Nature Writing 2004,</a> Steve Sailor notes: <blockquote><p>"In Iraq, as in much of the region, nearly half of all married couples are first or second cousins to each other. A 1986 study of 4,500 married hospital patients and staff in Baghdad found that 46% were wed to a first or second cousin, while a smaller 1989 survey found 53% were 'consanguineously' married. The most prominent example of an Iraqi first cousin marriage is that of Saddam Hussein and his first wife Sajida." </p></blockquote>Apparently this is the norm in much of the Muslim world, and is even blamed for the <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/homeaffairs/story/0,11026,1643683,00.html">disproportionate number of genetic defects</a> among British Pakistanis. I guess many Iraqis would not be able to find wedded bliss in the U.S.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.ncsl.org/programs/cyf/cousin%20map.gif" width="500" />
