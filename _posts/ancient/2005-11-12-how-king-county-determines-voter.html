A team of people in the elections office goes through ballots to determine "voter intent" in close races. [<a href="http://www.soundpolitics.com/archives/005314.html">see Sharkansky</a>]. But the decisions can be very arbitrary, and in my opinion directly manipulable if those doing the counting are biased. What do you think the intent was on each of these ballots?:<br /><img src="http://soundpolitics.com/Overvote2.jpg" width=300/><br /><p><br /><img src="http://soundpolitics.com/Clear10.jpg" width=300/><br />(note: the green and red marks are from the elections official determining the intent)<br /></p>
