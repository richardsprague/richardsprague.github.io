<p>The <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003675484_mercerkids21e.html">Seattle Times writes</a> (and Melissa <a href="http://saveseattleschools.blogspot.com/2007/04/mercer-island-teens-and-big-picture.html">blogs</a>&nbsp; at <a href="http://saveseattleschools.blogspot.com/">SaveSeattleSchools</a>) about an upcoming study on anxiety among affluent kids, by <a href="http://www.tc.columbia.edu/faculty/index.htm?facid=sl504">Suniya S. Luthar</a>, professor of psychology and education at Teachers College, Columbia University.&nbsp; The study was paid for by a Department of Health grant to the Mercer Island Communities That Care, an initiative to reduce teen drinking and drug use in a project coordinated by <a href="mailto:suzanne.tedesko@mercergov.org">Suzanne Tedesko</a> on the <a href="http://www.ci.mercer-island.wa.us/StaffDirectory.asp">Mercer Island City staff</a>.&nbsp; From the Times:</p> <blockquote> <p>Results of a communitywide survey Luthar did on Mercer Island replicated many of her earlier findings on affluent youth and substance abuse. It showed a steep jump between junior high and high school in the percentage of students who used alcohol, cigarettes or drugs. A lack of contact with their parents contributed to distress among youth, according to the report.</p> <p>Mercer Island High School students were far more likely to display anxiety, depression, withdrawal, trouble sleeping, social problems and rule-breaking behavior than the norm, the survey said.</p></blockquote> <p>Luthar is speaking Monday night at 7pm at the High School and I'll try to attend.&nbsp; (She's also <a href="http://parentmap.com/lecture5.htm">presenting in Bellevue on Tuesday,</a> but instead of free you have to pay $20 -- I wonder if it's the same talk?)  <p>I'm skeptical of the idea that Mercer Island kids are more likely to do drugs because they're burned out from all that overscheduling from their&nbsp;hyper-competitive parents who think getting into Stanford is the only thing that matters.&nbsp; Why would kids today, whether affluent or not, be any more "overscheduled" than farm kids or those in hungry hunter-gatherer communities?  <p>Fortunately, it looks like Dr. Luthar has read <a href="http://richardsprague.blogspot.com/2006/05/no-two-alike-book.html">Judith Rich Harris</a> and Steven Pinker, whose thesis is that stress within families matters much less than peer group influences.&nbsp; In other words, parents' overscheduling is pretty inconsequential compared to, say, those friends from the Rave party you let your daughter attend.  <p>So does Mercer Island have a drug problem?&nbsp; Nationally, about 45% have never touched the stuff according to <a href="http://www.casacolumbia.org/pdshopprov/shop/item.asp?itemid=66">The National Center On Addiction and Substance Abuse</a>. That same 45% claim not to have any friends who use drugs either.&nbsp; In fact only about 17% of kids are considered "high risk" -- have used drugs in the past 30 days.&nbsp; In their 2004 paper <a href="http://faculty.tc.columbia.edu/upload/sl504/LutharSexton2004Highpriceofaffluence.pdf">The High Price of Affluence</a>, Luthar along with Chris Sexton, report findings from an affluent community that shows 50% never do drugs -- hey, that's actually <em>better </em>than the national average, though slightly worse than the less affluent school that the study used. <p>One interesting part of their 2004 study divided the students into self-identified peer groups (Populars, Jocks, Intelligent, Theater, Preppies, Independent, Druggies, and more).&nbsp; Turns out that Populars are more likely to do drugs, which to me explains why it can <em>seem</em> like there is more substance abuse than there really is.&nbsp; Unfortunately the paper I saw only describes the high level of the study; I'd love to see the actual data and understand this peer group division better. <p>I'll wait to hear more from Dr. Luthar, but after some reading I'm inclined to think that&nbsp;if your Mercer Island kid is involved in high-risk behavior, you need to know he/she is part of a small minority of students -- it's not "normal" or "typical", whether they are overscheduled or not.</p>
