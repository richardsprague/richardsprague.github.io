<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/hanson/hanson200509300811.asp">Victor Davis Hanson </a>finally answers the questions I've been asking for a while.  It's very easy to pick on the U.S. involvement in Iraq [insert all your favorite reasons why the place is a mess], and by the way what happened to all the WMD we were supposed to find there?  "Bush lied, people died".  "Why didn't we give the inspectors a chance?"
<br />
<br />But what if we hadn't invaded?  Saddam & crew would still be out there...doing what? The sanctions would almost certainly have ended by now. Of course the U.S. government would have continued to refuse opening diplomatic and trade relations, but what about France and others? The oil-for-food program enriched Saddam, but at least it placed some superficial constraints on his cronies' ability to spend the money. What if there had been no constraints?  What if Iraq were just like North Korea today, only wealthy and strategically located?
