<p>The University of Washington has a new map of <a href="http://geomapnw.ess.washington.edu/index.php?toc=maintoc&amp;body=services\publications\map\mercer.html">Mercer Island's geology</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't see anything particularly unsettling (so-to-speak)about our neighborhood:</p> <p><img height="253" src="http://s90651691.onlinehome.us/images/mercerislandgeology84thave.png" width="400"> </p> <p>We're sitting on "Vashon subglacial till" (purple), which is between Vashon recessional deposits (orange) and "Pre-Fraser non-glacial deposits" (green). The jagged lines near us are "scarps", which in our case are those big dirt cliffs behind our neighbors across the street. <p>No fault lines, no artificial fill: just nice glacial deposits from the Pleistocene Era.</p>
