It's a trend that has interested me <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2011/02/coming-wave-of-sensors.html">for a while</a>: as hardware becomes more important, it's becoming easier to build. When I first fell in love with computers a zillion years ago, they were mostly hardware -- and scary.&nbsp; Poor, starving student that I was, every mistake learning or building hardware cost real money, and it wasn't until software came along that I could feel comfortable playing and learning new things at will: software was infinitely tolerant of the inevitable problems.&nbsp; Software development is a fixed investment: buy a computer and start writing; worst case you just reboot and start over if something goes wrong. Well, now hardware is beginning to look the same way.  <p>Lower costs are one driver: 3D printers go for (sometimes a lot) less than $2,000 -- which by the way is about what my first computer cost.&nbsp; But even if that's too much, there are so many local shops that will lend you their equipment, either as part of Neil Gershenfeld's <a href="http://cba.mit.edu/">Center for Bits and Atoms</a> worldwide bunch <a href="http://wiki.fablab.is/wiki/Portal:Labs">of fab labs</a>&nbsp; (none yet in China or Seattle, unfortunately) or the <a href="http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/List_of_Hacker_Spaces">hackerspaces</a> all over or <a href="http://www.techshop.ws/">techshops </a>or in Seattle we have <a href="http://metrixcreatespace.com/">Metrixcreate:Space</a> and the new <a href="http://www.makerhaus.com/">Makerhaus</a>.&nbsp; Most of these places let you use this equipment on site for a reasonable cost (dozens of dollars, or maybe a hundred or two for a month), and usually have staff or other friendly people on hand to help. Chris Anderson points out that the original <a href="https://squareup.com/">Square </a>hardware was built in one of these shops. (I've been to the Seattle ones a few times -- they're great! ) <p>But it’s more than cost. As hardware starts to imitate the flexibility of software, entire new businesses and ecosystems are possible.&nbsp; There’s <a href="http://brickarms.com/">Brickarms.com</a>, by a Redmond Washington engineer who makes Lego-compatible toy weapons or <a href="http://rayshobby.net/?page_id=160">OpenSprinker</a>, a $199 lawn system that cost a total of $5,000 to invent and bring to market. Lego Digital Designer is a free CAD program that lets you design LEGO projects, then generate step-by-step instructions for how to build them. There is a huge gallery from users, and until early 2012 you could order (for a fee) complete boxed sets for whatever you created. There's even <a href="http://www.localmotors.com/">Local Motors</a>, a street-legal car 430 horsepower custom car company.  <p>Even biology is getting into the action with Do It Yourself (DIY) Bio like Josh Perfetto with his <a href="http://openpcr.org/">$599 thermocycler</a> for cheap PCR and DremelFuge, a a 3D head you mount on a Dremel rotary tool to act like a 33Krpm centrifuge for a fraction of the price of the one used by "real" scientists.  <p>Some of this is what Blogger Jason Kottke calls <a href="http://kottke.org/09/09/small-batch-businesses">"small batch"</a> manufacturing, how normal people are becoming empowered to become craftsmen, artisans, able to make custom products for people who know how to appreciate them.&nbsp; A classic example is <a href="http://www.tcho.com/">TCHO Chocolate</a>, the San Francisco-based boutique food maker founded by some Wired people.&nbsp; <p>To get started, there are great new marketplaces popping up from crowd-funding sites like <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a>, <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/">Indiegogo</a>, <a href="http://www.rockethub.com/">RocketHub</a>, <a href="http://fundedbyme.com/">FundedbyMe</a> and more, enabling entirely new business models for funding and bootstrapping companies.  <p>Chris Anderson, long-time journalist believes in this enough that he recently quit his job as Editor-in-Chief at Wired in order to go full-time into <a href="http://store.diydrones.com/">3D Robotics</a>, a new aerospace company with revenues that grew from $250K in the first year, to $3M in 2011.&nbsp; He started this literally in his living room, ran it as a side project using a social networking site to attract a community of users, until it was big enough that he decided to make it his day job. <p>It’s true, of course, that applying software business models to the world of hardware will bring about important changes in business generally and this book documents how open source and community-driven development will drive those innovations. But it will require more attention to marketing and PR than many would-be entrepreneurs appreciate. It’s one thing for the editor of a famous magazine to start a community and watch thousands of people join; it’s a much tougher proposition, at least at the beginning, for the rest of us.  <p>There’s much more to say about this, but if you want to get started, here’s a great list of tools that Chris Anderson keeps for his own workbench:  <blockquote> <p>Software:  <ul> <li>Inkscape is a Mac/Win open source version of Illustrator  <li>3d scanning: Audodesk123D has a windows version  <li>laser cutting: see Autdesk 123D Make</li></ul> <p>Tools in his workshop:  <ul> <li>MakerBot Cupcake  <li>MakerBot Cyclops 3-D scanner  <li>MyDIYCNC  <li>Hitachi desktop bandsaw  <li>Dremel workstation/drill press  <li>Weller WES51 soldering station  <li>Picoscope USB oscilloscope  <li>Saleae USB logic analyzer  <li>Volleman Power supply / Multimeter / Soldering station  <li>Software </li> <ul> <li>Illustrator (for laser cutting drawings)  <li>Autodesk 123D  <li>Cadsoft Eagle (for PCB design)  <li>Arduino, Notepad++  <li>TortoiseSVN and TotoiseGIT for source code control</li></ul></ul></blockquote> <p>Get going!</p>
