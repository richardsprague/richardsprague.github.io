<p>I'm here in the Boston airport now, accessing the Internet on my laptop:</p> <p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2057/2069126613_d5b87e2952.jpg?v=0"> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Big deal,&nbsp;people do that all the time right?&nbsp; Take a closer look.&nbsp; That gadget next to my seat is my Treo, and it's not wired to my laptop.&nbsp; It's using an entirely wireless bluetooth connection to&nbsp;give my&nbsp;laptop a high-speed internet connection using Verizon's new <a href="http://www.vzam.net/">VZAccess software</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Costs me about 50 cents/day.&nbsp; What a deal!&nbsp; Now I can be online anywhere I can get a cell phone connection.</p>
