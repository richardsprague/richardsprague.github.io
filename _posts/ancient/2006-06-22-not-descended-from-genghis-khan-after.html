I mentioned last week that <a href="http://richardsprague.blogspot.com/2006/05/how-i-am-related-to-genghis-kha.html">this news</a> about being related to Genghis Khan is less interesting than it appears, now the NYTimes reports that the accountant in Florida is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/21/science/21genghis.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">not a direct descendent</a> after all.  A second, more detailed test, by rival firm Family Tree DNA of Houston, showed that the first test was a fluke.<br /><br />I've been skeptical of these tests because I'm not sure what kinds of quality controls exist for these companies, and I suspect that you might get different results depending on who does the test and when.
