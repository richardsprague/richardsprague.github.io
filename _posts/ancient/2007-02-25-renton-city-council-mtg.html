<p></p> <p>As many Mercer Island residents as possible are needed at the Renton City Council meeting&nbsp;Monday Feb 26th&nbsp;at 7:00pm.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike &nbsp;MI City Council meetings, you need to request prior to the meeting that you want to make a short (~3 minute) comment. &nbsp;If you arrive at 6:30-6:45pm, you can make your request then. &nbsp;The meeting takes place at:<br>Renton City Hall, 7th Floor Council Chambers<br>1055 South Grady Way<br>Renton, WA 98057<br>Phone: (425) 430-6501<br>For directions: <a href="http://rentonwa.gov/government/default.aspx?id=1172">http://rentonwa.gov/government/default.aspx?id=1172</a><br>==================<br>&nbsp;The City Council is going into a "retreat" later next week and discussing the airport is on the agenda of that retreat. &nbsp;So this is a good opportunity to leave them with some thoughts. &nbsp;It would also help to put comments in writing and coming with enough copies so that they can be handed to each City Council member right there at the meeting. &nbsp;That way the council members have something to read and think about prior to the retreat.</p>
