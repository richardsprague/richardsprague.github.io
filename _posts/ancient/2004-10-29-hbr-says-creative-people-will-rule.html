<div class="Section1"> <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Tom Peters posts this clip from the latest <em><i><a href="http://www.harvardbusinessonline.com/" title="http://www.harvardbusinessonline.com/"><font face="Times New Roman">Harvard Business Review</font></a></i></em></span></font></p> <blockquote style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt'> <div> <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>"America's Looming Creativity Crisis," by Richard Florida:</span></font></p> <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>"The Dawn of the Creative Age": "There's a whole new class of workers in the U.S. that's 38-million strong: the creative class. At its core are the scientists, engineers, architects, designers, educators, artists, musicians and entertainers whose economic function is to create new ideas, new technology, or new content. Also included are the creative professions of business and finance, law, healthcare and related fields, in which knowledge workers engage in complex problem solving that involves a great deal of independent judgment. Today the creative sector of the U.S. economy, broadly defined, employs more than 30% of the workforce (more than all of manufacturing) and accounts for more than half of all wage and salary income (some $2 trillion)&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;almost as much as the manufacturing and service sectors together. Indeed, the United States has now entered what I call the Creative Age."</span></font></p> <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>"The global talent pool and the high-end, high margin creative industries that used to be the sole province of the U.S., and a critical source of its prosperity, have begun to disperse around the globe. A host of countries&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;Ireland, Finland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, among them&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;are investing in higher education, cultivating creative people, and churning out stellar products, from Nokia phones to the <em><i><font face="Times New Roman">Lord of the Rings</font></i></em> movies. Many of these countries have learned from past U.S. success and are shoring up efforts to attract foreign talent&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&sbquo;&not;&acirc;&euro;including Americans. ... The United States may well be the Goliath of the twentieth century global economy, but it will take just half a dozen twenty-first-century Davids to begin to wear it down. To stay innovative, America must continue to attract the world's sharpest minds. And to do that, it needs to invest in the further development of its creative sector. Because wherever creativity goes&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and, by extension, wherever talent goes&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;innovation and economic growth are sure to follow."</span></font></p></div></blockquote></div>
