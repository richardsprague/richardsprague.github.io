Finally, Adobe is making <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/premiereel/indepth.html">video editing software</a> for people like me. Offhand I can see several neat new features:
<br /><ul><li>16:9 support</li><li>Great audio control over individual waveforms</li><li>Real-time rendering that takes advantage of your GPU</li></ul>I'll look at this more carefully and maybe I'll switch instead of upgrading from the Pinnacle Studio 8 that I use now.
