The Book Industry Study Group calculated the size of the used book market and the results are published today in <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002527428_usedbookboom29.html">Seattle Times </a>as well as <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB112793907533954842,00.html?mod=pj%5Fgadgets%5Fhs%5Fcoll%5Fleft">WSJ.com - The Growing Market For Slightly Used Books</a>: "While the market's size is still modest -- about $600 million, or 2.8% of the $21 billion that readers spent on consumer books in 2004 -- it is growing at 25% annually. Jeff Hayes, group director for InfoTrends Research Group, suggests that it could reach $2.25 billion in U.S. sales by 2010, or 9.4% of a projected $23.9 billion in consumer book sales."

<br />Some of my thoughts:
<br /><ol><li>Textbooks already work this way and publishers have adapted by insisting on more frequent updates. The market for the 14th edition of a popular Calculus textbook disappears when the 15th edition comes out.</li>
<br /><li>It's a matter of time before the same thing happens to lots of other businesses.  Why buy a new anything if you can buy a slightly-used version for less money.</li></ol>
