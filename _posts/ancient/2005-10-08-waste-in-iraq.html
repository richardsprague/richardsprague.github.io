I wonder what the point of such a story would be:<br /><br /><ol><li>Help the fledgling Iraqi democracy become more efficient. Our troops fighting the War on Terror need to know we are doing everything possible to increase the legitimacy of the Iraqi government. </li><br /><li>Expose the War for the sham that it is. Wake up a few more people to the madness of it all, so we can just get out.</li><br /><li>Impeach Bush. His incompetence in Iraq is equalled only by his incompetence on domestic issues. </li></ol><br /><br />The Left is in long-term decline because it no longer appeals to "normal" Americans. It would be hard (impossible?) to find a journalist in the Mainstream Media who could write honestly from the perspective of #1, so most Americans will just glaze over the story, essentially ignoring it as yet another trumped-up variation on #2 or #3--ideas which a slim (but solid) <a href="http://newsbusters.org/node/1201">majority of people find revolting</a>.<br /><br />Absolutely everyone, George Bush most of all, wishes we didn't have to be in Iraq. What we really need are <a href="http://bermans.blogs.com/opinion/">constructive</a>, <a href="http://www.thomaspmbarnett.com/weblog/">realistic </a>proposals for what we should do now.
