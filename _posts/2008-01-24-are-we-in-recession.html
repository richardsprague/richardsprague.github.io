<p>Everything I know about macro-economics I learned in classes from my old finance professor <a href="http://www.jeremysiegel.com/">Jeremy Siegel</a>, so I basically trust everything he says, and he says no in a <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/audio/KW_Siegel_Allen_012208.mp3">new podcast</a> from <a href="mailto:Knowledge@Wharton">Knowledge@Wharton</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's an optimist like me, and I've watched him come a long way since last year when he said 25%, then 30% chance of a recession, until now he thinks "professional economists" say the odds are 50-50.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bottom line: the Fed's recent cut will help, the politically-inspired government giveaway won't, and property prices will fall about 15% before bottoming out.&nbsp; Interestingly, he thinks there are some parallels to the bubble situation in Japan in the 1980s, but says we're responding far more appropriately. </p> <p>I've been fairly cash-heavy for the past several months so at these new stock market prices, I'm going on a buying spree.</p>
