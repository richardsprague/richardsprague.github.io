<p>Work has kept me so busy lately that I haven’t had time to do much of anything, so imagine my frustration when I heard that tell-tale “pop” noise coming from my rear right tire as I drove down I-405 on my way home late last night.&#160; But the car still rode okay, so it wasn’t till I was home that I discovered this tire was not repairable.</p>  <p><a title="Flat tire" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2985992060/"><img height="177" alt="Flat tire" src="http://static.flickr.com/3239/2985992060_e1c32ddb68.jpg" width="236" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>Immediately I checked PriusChat and found that the best tire for a Prius is the <a href="http://priuschat.com/forums/care-maintenance-troubleshooting/54686-nokian-tires-what-difference.html" target="_blank">Nokian WR</a>, which goes for something like $160+ each at places like the <a href="http://www.tirefactory.com/search.cfm" target="_blank">Tire Factory</a> in Redmond.&#160;&#160; Turns out that my Prius Touring Edition has 16” wheels, which are not terribly easy to find in stock in any case.&#160; Other people recommended the Michelin Pilot Primacy (also sold at Costco), but at $163 it actually costs about the same as the Nokian and doesn’t get as good gas mileage.&#160; Didn’t matter, cuz it wasn’t in stock at the places I called.</p>  <p>Argh.&#160; Long story short I ended up going to my <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2006/12/free-tire-repair-at-les-schwab.html" target="_blank">favorite tire place, Les Schwab</a>, who sold me the <a href="http://www.toyo.com/docs/tires/tires.asp?lpid=18966&amp;name=Proxes%20T1R%E2%84%A2&amp;category=sport" target="_blank">Toyo Proxes T1R</a>, for about $350 for two of them, installed.&#160; It’s a sport tire, so supposedly I’ll get better handling, but I really wanted better fuel economy.&#160; I guess that’s the down side of the Touring Edition Prius—you end up with sport tires because nobody keeps anything else in stock.</p>
