<p> 23andme says I’m a <a href="https://www.23andme.com/you/journal/pre_caffeine_metabolism/overview/">slow caffeine metabolizer</a> because I have the AC genotype at SNP <a href="https://www.23andme.com/you/explorer/snp/?snp_name=rs762551">rs762551</a>. You’d think that means I’m extra sensitive to caffeine before bedtime, but that’s not the case: I sleep just fine even if I have a cup of high-octane coffee after dinner. My 99-year-old grandmother drinks coffee by the potful, crediting its warmth as a calming effect to make her drowsy.</p><p>This week's <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21657765-novel-approach-pest-control-beetles-and-bugs">Economist points</a> to a new study in <a href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150714/ncomms8618/full/ncomms8618.html#ref20">Nature</a> by Javier A. Ceja-Navarro et al that names <em>Pseudomonas Fulva</em> as a bacterium active in the guts of a coffee bean pest. Caffeine is normally toxic to insects, but P. Fulva neutralizes the caffeine, apparently using the demethylase ndmA gene. </p><p>I wish I knew enough genetics to test a theory that occurs to me: maybe my own caffeine metabolism is also affecting by a similar gut bacteria that I have in abundance but which is missing in other people. I already checked for Pseudomonas Fulva — I don’t have it in any of my uBiome samples.  I <em>do </em>have abundant levels of the genus Pseudomonas, but that is not the same thing.</p><p>It should be possible to screen every one of my gut bacteria demethylizing ndMA gene, but I’m not sure how to do that. If I <em>did</em> find the gene in one of the gut bacteria I harbor, then that would be pretty cool: a microbe that helps me drink coffee.</p><p><img title="coffeeBeans.png" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EMT90m-2IGU/VarJHOtRNAI/AAAAAAADQps/0eVRA8f81ZY/coffeeBeans.png?imgmax=800" alt="Coffee Beans" width="425" height="294" border="0" /></p><p> </p><p> </p>
