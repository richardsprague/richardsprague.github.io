<p>We take more photos than any family I know, enough that&nbsp;our kids probably think their parents have lenses attached to&nbsp;our faces. &nbsp;When you take that many pictures, some of them are bound to turn out to be interesting enough that somebody else might want to buy them. <p>I have no interest in going through the trouble to get extra change from this, but a friend at work recently <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jcalev/archive/2007/08/22/my-experiences-with-microstock-photography.aspx">wrote up his experiences</a> selling to sites like <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/">Shutterstock</a> and <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com">iStockPhoto</a>. He makes about $150/month, on a few hundred images he's uploaded over the years. Basically these sites give you a cut (25 cents or so) per photo their users download; users are charged from $1 to $10+ depending on the resolution. <p>Most of the pictures people buy, apparently, are travel-related; something to consider if you go on trips to places like Switzerland, Argentina, or China.</p>
