<p>It’s as impressive as you’d expect: full-blown Probat roaster right out in the open, a long line of Clovers at the main bar, </p><div>As a tourist attraction it doesn’t disappoint: even in a city known for gourmet coffee shops, you won’t find a better example of showmanship and art. They obviously spent a great deal of time and money planning all the details. But it also means long lines (you’ll wait at least 20 minutes to get a coffee) and impossible parking. (Although I noticed they offer valet parking if you want to go that way).</div><div> </div><div>I tried the <a href="http://store.starbucks.com/starbucks-reserve-ethiopia-konga/011044083,default,pd.html">Ethiopian Konga</a>, which my understanding is another name for Yrgecheffe coffee, which became my favorite after trying it at <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/08/kongo-co-op-from-terroir-coffee.html">Terroir in Boston</a> a few years ago. Yes I asked for it <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/03/clover-coffee-sells-to-man.html">Clover-brewed</a> rather than a hand-pour. </div><div> </div><div><img title="IMG_8118.jpg" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-1UmjpENLzN0/VLGzn_FtSoI/AAAAAAAC9Y8/teSBE3e-YdI/IMG_8118.jpg?imgmax=800" alt="Starbucks Reserve" width="450" height="600" border="0" /></div>
