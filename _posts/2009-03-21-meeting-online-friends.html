I can’t wait till the technology becomes ubiquitous enough that more of my friends are able to meet spontaneously this way. </p>  <p>One thing we talked about was my experience living in Japan years ago, where it seemed like I was constantly bumping into people I knew.&#160; Of course it was easy to spot me back then, since I’m so much taller and just stick out in a crowd of Japanese people.&#160; But I’m convinced that the same thing happens right now, wherever I am, but I just don’t know about it because we get lost in the crowd.&#160; What happens in the future when technology makes that it possible to stick out of the crowd no matter where you are?</p>
