<p>The WSJ has a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB116485245948336506.html">rundown on companies</a> that will buy your current contract and resell to somebody else, in a legal way to get rid of your cell phone contract. It's good for buyers too, because you can get&nbsp;much cheaper phone service with a shorter contract life.</p> <p><img src="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/images/PJ-AJ115_pjRECE_20061129211224.gif"></p>
