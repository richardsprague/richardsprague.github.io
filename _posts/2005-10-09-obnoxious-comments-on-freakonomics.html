<br /><br />steven Levitt, author of Freakonomics,  is having a <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2005/10/downside-of-blogs.html">problem on his blog</a> with people who post annoying comments.<br /><br />Here's what I said to him:<br /><br /><blockquote>Yes of course you should ban anonymous comments. Registration is free and easy, and it ensures the legitimacy of anyone motivated enough to respond.<br /><br />You might check into the "trackback" feature available on many blog sites. People's comments appear on their own sites, not yours, but anyone can still read and respond by doing a simple search for comments to your original post. That way you can still get the feedback you want from the world at large while ignoring the <a href="http://isteve.blogspot.com">obnoxious posters </a><br /></blockquote>
