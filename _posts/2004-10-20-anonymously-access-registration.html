<a href="http://www.bugmenot.com/faq.php">BugMeNot.com</a> is an idea whose time has come. If you need to view content on one of those sites (like NYTimes) that requires registration, type the URL into bugmenot instead.  They enter a fake ID for you so you can view the content without telling the site who you are.
<br />
<br />I don't mind registering at NYTimes or other places I use a lot, but sometimes I don't want to be bothered with entering fake info about myself just to view something once.
