Lots of people are <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/local/newyork/nyc-suic1107,0,7756290.story?coll=ny-nynews-headlines">reporting </a>on that guy who committed suicide at Ground Zero, apparently distraught over the Kerry defeat.
<br />
<br />But wait a second: don't they believe in gun control in NYC?  Obviously not if he was able to bring one into lower Manhattan.  I would have thought in one of the bluest states of all, they would have passed a law by now that makes it a crime to carry a gun.
