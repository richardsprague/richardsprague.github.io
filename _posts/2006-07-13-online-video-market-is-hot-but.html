My alma mater discusses <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1519">the future of TV</a>, especially given the rise of Youtube and Guba. My old marketing prof says:<br /><blockquote>Fader's view of the future includes scenarios such as the following: A consumer is watching a baseball game on TV and has a laptop by the couch. With the laptop, the viewer calls up a replay of recent action via MLB.com. 'Things are clearly moving in that direction,' says Fader. 'I'm never going to watch 'Grey's Anatomy' over a [portable] wireless device, but I may watch a preview before seeing it on TV.'<br /></blockquote>
