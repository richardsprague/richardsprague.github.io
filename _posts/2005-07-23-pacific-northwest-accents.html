<br />An interesting piece on KUOW yesterday morning ( <a href="http://www.kuow.org/defaultProgram.asp?ID=9198">transcript </a>and <a href="http://www.kuow.org/m3u/050722_accent.m3u">audio </a>(3 min)) about research at U-W and Portland State on regional accents.<br /><br /><ul><li>To NW speakers, the vowels are the same in "odd" and "ought".</li><br /><li>Natives often drop the ending -ed, saying "can fruit" instead of "canned fruit"</li></ul><br />Quotes from Jennifer Ingle, who did a whole study on <a href="http://www.aip.org/149th/ingle.html">accents in Ballard</a> that was written up in the <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/225139_nwspeak20.html">Seattle P</a>I a few months ago, which noted that Northwesterners<br /> <ul><li>say "bucket" instead of "pail"</li><br /><li>emphasize the 's' in words</li><li>use only 14 out of 15 American English vowel sounds.</li><br /></ul>Guess I'll have to start watching my kids carefully to keep them from losing their God-given right to all 15 vowels.<br />
