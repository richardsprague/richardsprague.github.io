<p>Here&rsquo;s another test of BlogJet, which I am trying to try as a new offline blog editor.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://blogjet.com/images/bjlogo2.gif" border="0" /></p><p>I already tested it on my <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sprague/archive/2005/08/24/455627.aspx">.Text Blog</a>, so now I&rsquo;m trying it on Blogger. It appears to have a few advantages over what I&rsquo;ve used previously:</p><ul><li>It&rsquo;s truly WYSIWYG, including things like support for bullets.</li><li>Apparently can easily be configured to upload directly from an FTP server (but I don&rsquo;t have that part working yet).</li><li>It&rsquo;s&nbsp;paid software, so presumably you get better support than from freeware.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
