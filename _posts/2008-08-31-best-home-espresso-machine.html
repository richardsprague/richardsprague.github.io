<p>I'm still using my <a href="http://coffeegeek.com/reviews/consumer/starbucks_barista">humble Starbucks Barrista,</a> purchased almost ten years ago and still going strong, faithfully producing my raw milk latte every single morning.&nbsp; A friend who is looking to purchase his own system asked my advice for which one I'd buy today.&nbsp; I haven't been in the market for a while so I'm not sure what's out there, but now I see that my favorite coffee shop <a href="http://www.espressovivace.com/homemachine.html">Espresso Vivace advises the GS/3</a>, from <a href="http://www.us.franke-cs.com/dept.aspx?d_id=25138">Franke Coffee Systems</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The GS/3 dramatically resets the gold standard for performance among all espresso machines. Its performance meets and surpasses the finest high volume machines on the market today. In a tiny footprint, with water reservoir or plumb-in options, GS/3 suits high-end home use and has sufficient steam power and performance for many commercial applications including restaurants, catering, and professional offices.</p></blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;<img src="https://is1.eporia.com/company_162/184397.jpg?qlt=80&amp;cell=358,358&amp;cvt=jpeg"> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Contact your Franke regional sales manager for <a href="http://www.home-barista.com/forums/frankes-u-s-la-marzocco-gs3-notice-and-shipping-schedule-t5086.html">purchasing details</a>.&nbsp; Oh wait, I see it <a href="http://stores.ebay.com/HITECHESPRESSO-COM-since-1991">listed on eBay</a> for a mere $6300.&nbsp; Hmmm.&nbsp; Time to raid my children's college fund?&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I get my wife to agree.&nbsp; Let's see, if I drink $4 worth of Starbucks a day, it would pay for itself in only, what, four years! Please, honey!</p>
