<p>Mike at <a href="http://trabantcoffee.com/">Trabant Coffee and Chai</a> saw that I was looking for more <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/08/kongo-co-op-from-terroir-coffee.html">Ethiopia Yergcheffe Konga coffee</a> (it’s sooo good!), and let me know that a new batch is now available from <a href="http://www.49thparallelroasters.com/">49th Parallel Roasters</a> and it’s in stock now in Seattle.&#160; So I rushed over to their Pioneer Square store and picked up a fresh 12-oz bag and this morning I enjoyed another, heavenly-wonderful, handmade raw milk latte with those excellent beans.</p>  <p><a title="49th parallel konga coffee" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2897608578/"><img alt="49th parallel konga coffee" src="http://static.flickr.com/3197/2897608578_89ebb3fc4a.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>I even gave a cup to the piano teacher at our house this afternoon.&#160; She’ll be back, I assure you.</p>
