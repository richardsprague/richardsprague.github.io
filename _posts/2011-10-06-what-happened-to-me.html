<p>I just spent eleven nights in the hospital – four of them in ICU. I’ve always been a pretty healthy guy. What happened? </p>  <p>The short answer: a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001306/" target="_blank">bowel obstruction</a> – a kink somewhere in my intestines that kept food from passing through – plus <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001179/" target="_blank">aspiration pneumonia</a>, which I contracted shortly after they inserted a three-meter tube through my nose and into my tummy.</p>  <p>Exactly two weeks ago, I boarded a plane to <a href="http://www.tripit.com/trip/public/id/60E85CB5FDBC" target="_blank">return to Beijing</a> feeling a little tummy ache – I thought it was some Mexican food I’d eaten – but the high altitude of the flight – which tends to bloat the internal organs—apparently worsened the situation enough that I was pretty sick by the time I arrived, unable to hold food or water. I pulled myself together enough to complete my <a href="http://macworldasia.com/Home/Schedule" target="_blank">MacWorld keynote address</a>, and then headed straight to a clinic for treatment.</p>  <p><a title="I&#39;m in the hospital." href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/6175700552/"><img title="XRay when I entered the hospital" border="0" alt="Those horizontal lines are not good: it means something is blocking the normal passage of liquids." src="http://static.flickr.com/6179/6175700552_0e5424e5c2.jpg" width="293" height="388" /></a></p>  <p>Bowel obstructions are nearly unheard of in younger people, but in my case the cause is clear: abdominal surgery as a child left bits of scar tissue that accumulated over the years enough to occasionally wrap around the intestines. Although full obstructions can be somewhat common with a history like mine, I lasted nearly thirty years without trouble, and I’m hopeful that this time was just a fluke that won’t bother me again.</p>  <p>Treatment is pretty straightforward: doctors insert a tube to let the pressure off the obstructed area, and wait for it to heal naturally. Doctors try hard to avoid surgery – after all, it’s the surgical scar tissue that causes the problem in the first place –but it’s always a backup option in severe cases. I’m recovering fairly well, so that doesn’t seem to be a necessity for me.</p>  <p>The pneumonia, meanwhile, made my situation worse than it might have been. We’re not sure how I contracted it. I had a bit of a cold the previous week – did my weakened condition cause it to flare into something worse?&#160; Or, maybe in the process of inserting the tubes, something in my throat disturbed the lungs somehow and tipped me into a much worse situation?&#160; Either way, this was quite a scare and it necessitated the ICU, a week of breathing with an oxygen mask, and plenty of antibiotics, which I’ll need to continue taking for several more weeks. </p>  <p>It’s been two weeks and although I’m much improved, I’m not out of the woods yet. I’m recuperating at home, which of course is much better surroundings than in the Chinese hospital I left. This week is a Chinese holiday, and while it’s a bummer that I can’t get out and enjoy the vacation, I’m not missing any work either. For now I’ll just continue this way, taking it slowly until I’m back to my old self.</p>
