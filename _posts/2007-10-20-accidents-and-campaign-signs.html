<p>I'll be glad when the election is over and the candidates start to clean up their litter, but sometimes <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/08/50-maureen-judge-signs.html">I wish it weren't illegal</a> to remove some of them right now.&nbsp; </p> <p>I was trying to turn left onto Island Crest from 86th Ave&nbsp;in the pouring rain&nbsp;last night and look what blocked my view of the oncoming traffic:</p> <p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2201/1655472865_a8d22ab74b.jpg?v=0"> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Question #1: Do you think this sign placement&nbsp;helps or hurts this candidate?</p> <p>Question #2: Which is more dangerous: a campaign sign that blocks the view of traffic, or an idiot who tries to take a picture of it from his car while turning?&nbsp; :-)</p>
