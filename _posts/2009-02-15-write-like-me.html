<p>I’ve hate handwriting. I’ve been using keyboards since I learned to write and my fingers just don’t want to use a pen. But there are too many occasions when people expect the “personal” touch of a handwritten document, so I couldn’t get out of it completely.&#160; Until now.&#160; Using the free font-generation software at <a href="http://www.yourfonts.com">http://www.yourfonts.com</a>, I have a whole collection of handwriting fonts that let me give a personalized touch to computer-generated greeting cards and other documents I used to have to break out the pen for.&#160; I even made a “handwritten” CD label for a Valentines present.</p>  <p>The process couldn’t be simpler.&#160; The site is completely free; you don’t even need to register.&#160; Just print <a href="http://www.yourfonts.com/template.pdf" target="_blank">a one-sheet template</a> (don’t bother printing the second page, unless you care about special foreign characters).&#160; Scan it and <a href="http://www.yourfonts.com/upload.html" target="_blank">upload to the site</a>.&#160; Double-check that it looks right, and download to your hard drive.&#160; Presto – you have a font you can now use in any of your applications.&#160; I made one for each member of the family.</p>  <p>Here’s mine:</p>  <p><a title="Youfont sample" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/3316825959/"><img height="247" alt="Youfont sample" src="http://static.flickr.com/3455/3316825959_cb57f7a25d.jpg" width="439" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>and here’s the same text “written” by my eleven-year-old:</p>  <p><a title="Youfont sample" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/3317650964/"><img height="269" alt="Youfont sample" src="http://static.flickr.com/3645/3317650964_d0b2e281e3.jpg" width="436" border="0" /></a></p>  <p></p>  <p>It can take a few tries to get it perfect.&#160; You can see a few problems with vertical character placement on the above samples, for example.&#160; But it’s waaay better than writer’s cramp.</p>
