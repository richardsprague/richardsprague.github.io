We already know that a huge proportion of women graduates from top schools suspend their careers to raise children, but most of these appear to have been caught in this situation by surprise as they discover how difficult it is to be a "Super Mom".  Now the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/20/national/20women.html?ei=5090&amp;en=6a8e0c413c09c249&amp;ex=1284868800&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=print">New York Times says many are already planning this while in college</a>:
<br />
<br /><blockquote>"According to a 2000 survey of Yale alumni from the classes of 1979, 1984, 1989 and 1994, conducted by the Yale Office of Institutional Research, more men from each of those classes than women said that work was their primary activity - a gap that was small among alumni in their 20's but widened as women moved into their prime child-rearing years. Among the alumni surveyed who had reached their 40's, only 56 percent of the women still worked, compared with 90 percent of the men. 
<br />A 2005 study of comparable Yale alumni classes found that the pattern had not changed. Among the alumni who had reached their early 40's, just over half said work was their primary activity, compared with 90 percent of the men. Among the women who had reached their late 40's, some said they had returned to work, but the percentage of women working was still far behind the percentage of men. 
<br />A 2001 survey of Harvard Business School graduates found that 31 percent of the women from the classes of 1981, 1985 and 1991 who answered the survey worked only part time or on contract, and another 31 percent did not work at all, levels strikingly similar to the percentages of the Yale students interviewed who predicted they would stay at home or work part time in their 30's and 40's.</blockquote>
<br />
<br />Top quote from one of the Ivy League students interviewed:
<br /><blockquote>"Parents have such an influence on their children," Ms. Ku said. "I want to have that influence. Me!</blockquote>
<br />Also read this <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2126636/">critical Slate commentary</a>, which thinks the NYTimes is making a mountain out of a molehill.  
<br /><blockquote>I suspect a Times editor glommed onto the idea while overhearing some cocktail party chatterâ€”"Say, did you hear that Sam blew hundreds of thousands of dollars sending his daughter to Yale and now she and her friends say all they want in the future is to get married and stay at home?"</blockquote>
