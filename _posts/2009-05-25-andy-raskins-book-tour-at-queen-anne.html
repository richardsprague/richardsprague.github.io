<p>Andy Raskin and I first met in graduate school, where both of us were interested in Japan, and over the years we somehow keep bumping into each other, often in strange, coincidental ways.&#160; There was the time, for example, when he wrote <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.09/tuvalu.html" target="_blank">an article for Wired</a> about the country of Tuvalu and WebTV Networks, which (unbeknownst to him) just so happened to be the company where I was working.&#160; </p>  <p><a title="018" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/3564055147/"><img style="display: inline; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px" height="256" alt="018" src="http://static.flickr.com/3301/3564055147_fbee12d33c.jpg" width="341" align="right" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>A year ago, while in San Francisco for a press tour, my PR colleague and I found ourselves with some extra time in the middle of the day.&#160; Knowing that Andy was a writer with ties to the high-tech world, I thought it might be nice to look him up so my colleague suggested we stop at the Apple Store downtown for a bit while I tried to find his contact info.&#160; Of course, right at that moment, who should happen to walk into the Apple Store?&#160; (this photo was taken that day)</p>  <p>He told me he was working on a new book, that he had just signed a contract with Penguin and would be writing about some experiences he’d had with Japan and the inventor of instant ramen (who had died a few years ago).&#160; </p>  <p>Well I was pleased to hear that the book is now finished and that Andy will be in Seattle for a book signing at Queen Anne Bookshop on Tuesday, May 26th at 6:30.
