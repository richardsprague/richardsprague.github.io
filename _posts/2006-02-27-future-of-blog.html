I agree with the Business Week article <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/print/innovate/content/feb2006/id20060224_155318.htm">The Future of the Blog</a>: quote from Mena Trott, founder of Six Apart:<br /><br />"To most people, the important things they want to learn about have to do with people they know. <span style="color:#ff0000;">So I think personal blogs are really the future</span>, and with that comes a challenge for blogs to be more friendly and welcoming.
