My brother and his family live in Kenner, so we are following the disaster with deep personal interest.
<br />
<br />Here are some links of note:
<br /><a href="http://www.newmediamusings.com/blog/2005/08/citizen_journal.html">New Media Musings: Citizen journalism storm chasers</a>
<br />links to amateur videos of the hurricane aftermath.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.cnewmark.com/archives/000447.html">Craigs List </a>has special help for people affected.
<br />
<br />One ambitious blogger is posting a collection of <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/sdk">other good links</a>.
