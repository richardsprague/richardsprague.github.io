<p>My fourth grade daughter polled her classmates about their bedtimes.&nbsp; Of 24 responses, her data shows the median bedtime is 9:30pm.&nbsp;<img src="http://learning.educities.edu.tw/le/5time/images/clock_9_30.gif" align="left"> I remember my childhood bedtime being 8:30, so&nbsp;these kids seem late to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder what time they get up in the morning?</p> <p>Our elementary school doesn't start till 9am, in contrast to the 8am start for our previous school in Los Altos.&nbsp; Mercer Island shares buses among the schools, which is probably pretty common among schools like ours.&nbsp; Los Altos skimped and didn't have bus service because the neighborhoods are so compact that kids all walk to school -- and the Prop 13-limited California school systems needed to save money wherever they could. </p>
