I wish I had time to attend the monthly <a href="http://blog.meetup.com/1/">Weblogger Meetup </a>organized by <a href="http://www.anitarowland.com/">Anita Rowland </a>.  She sends a wonderful writeup after each meeting that summarizes the attendees, all of whom seem very interesting people.<br /><br />My problem with blogs (like many aspects of new technology) is that I don't know what I don't know.  This blog and <a href="http://sprague.wordpress.com/">others </a>I keep are my attempt to understand the technology by playing with it informally. I've been at it long enough (since late 2002) that I sortta know a lot of things, but it's nice to talk with others and find more tricks and tools.
