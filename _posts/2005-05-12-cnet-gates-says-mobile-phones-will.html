<br />I agree. Remember a few years ago how Palm was the center of the universe for PDAs until technology figured out how to give the same experience in a phone.  If you leave the driveway and you remember you forgot your Palm, you don't go back into the house to get it.  If you forget your phone?  If you forget your iPod?
