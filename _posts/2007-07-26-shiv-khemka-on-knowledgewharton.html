<p>Our old classmate, <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/india/article.cfm?articleid=4208">Shiv Khemka, is featured in a podcast</a> from the 2007 Wharton Economic Summit. He's VP of the SUN Group, a family business that invests in emerging markets.&nbsp; I listened to the podcast on my long traffic-congested commute today. Among other interesting observations, he points out that Putin's Russia is actually a good investment environment, thanks to the stability, if you know what you're doing.</p> <p>Another point: energy demand far, far outstrips supply in fast-growing economies like India and China. When asked what he thinks about "green" energy investments, his response is that these places need as much energy as they can get, from any source.</p> <p><img height="267" src="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/alumni/regional_alumni_meetings/2003/berlin/images/khemka.gif" width="213"></p>
