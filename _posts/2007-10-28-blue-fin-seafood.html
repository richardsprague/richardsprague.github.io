<p>Why do people classify sushi as ethnic (Japanese) cuisine, rather than seafood, which is what it really is?&nbsp; Some of the more high-end seafood places already classify it correctly, like at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.brguestrestaurants.com/restaurants/blue_fin/index.php">Blue Fin in Times Square</a>,where I had a wonderful lunch while in New York this week. The menu includes all the standard, fresh fish you'd expect from a seafood restaurant: crab, lobster, mahi, etc.&nbsp; but they also have sushi.&nbsp;</p> <p>It's such a good idea that I expect someday all seafood places will offer sushi too.</p> <p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2035/1793537275_d671b4ec6d.jpg?v=0"> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/3/22536/New-York/Midtown-West/Blue-Fin.html"><img height="36" alt="Blue Fin in New York" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/22536/minilink.gif" width="130"></a>
