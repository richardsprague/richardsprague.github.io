<p>Steve Jobs is <a href="http://d8.allthingsd.com/20100601/steve-jobs-session/">right</a>:</p><blockquote><p>When we were an agrarian nation, all cars were trucks, because that’s what you needed on the farm. But as vehicles started to be used in the urban centers, cars got more popular. Innovations like automatic transmission and power steering and things that you didn’t care about in a truck as much started to become paramount in cars. … PCs are going to be like trucks. They’re still going to be around, they’re still going to have a lot of value, but they’re going to be used by one out of X people</p></blockquote><p>But after living with an iPad since it was available last year, I'm thinking I still like trucks.  Most mornings I've been using Flipboard or Reeder to watch my various RSS feeds. But while the iPad is nice for lying in bed, or for spontaneous and quick reads when I have a minute to myself, it just can't beat the power of a truck, er, laptop.</p><p>I just outfitted myself with the updated <a href="http://netnewswireapp.com/2010/11/netnewswiremac-3-2-8/">NetNewsWire 3.2.8</a>, the one with the new Instapaper button. I need Instapaper so badly that I considered switching  (to Shrook, the only interesting-looking one in the Mac App Store, but I gave up when I found it doesn't sync to Google Reader), but now that I have it, I'm wondering why I don't stick to Mac for all my serious RSS reading. I also added the <a href="http://veritrope.com/reviews/netnewswire-to-evernote-single-headline-or-tab-export-applescript/">NetNewsWire to Evernote Applescrip</a>t on the Veritrope site; that plus the <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/index.html">FastScript utility from Red Sweater Software</a>, and I'm just a command-E away from sending all my interesting clippings immediately to Evernote for safe-keeping.  Try that on your iPad.</p><p>Sometimes a truck really is better.</p><p><img title="Truck stuck.JPG" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_sDbqdqESbOw/TUN0uvCHHNI/AAAAAAABtOo/GXX0MIQahok/Truck%20stuck.JPG?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="Trucks having a hard time passing each other (China)" width="350" height="262" /></p><p><img title="Trucks.JPG" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_sDbqdqESbOw/TUNz2dz3rbI/AAAAAAABtOg/vj1EH9VnxjQ/Trucks.JPG?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="Truck in China" width="350" height="262" /></p><p> </p><p> </p>
