<br />
<br />Lawrence Summers, President of Harvard, actually had the nerve to bring this up in a brainstorming academic conference where he was specifically encouraged to be "provocative".  No transcripts exist of the conference, specifically because they wanted to encourage free thinking without later fear of provacation, but it's interesting that when he made a hint that, like height, maybe some biology accounts for some of the differences between men and women and their interests in science.
<br />
<br />Denice Denton, chancellor designate at UC-Santa Cruz and currently an engineering prof at U-Washington, walked out of the conference as he made his remarks.  Oh yes, she loves the free exchange of ideas.
