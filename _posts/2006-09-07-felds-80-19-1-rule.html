<p>Brad Feld has the interesting insight that a <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FeldThoughts/~3/18027168/001937.html">content publisher should worry most about the 19%</a> who are left after the 1% of people who will actively participate in any new online venture (give up on the remaining 80% who are contributors only and won't actively participate).&nbsp; He also points to <a href="http://blog.tomevslin.com/2006/09/life_on_the_lon.html">Tom Evslin's site</a> where you can even download an Excel file to model this.</p> <p>My quick take: you engage the 19% by offering them a way to participate that is&nbsp;brain-dead simple. For example, Amazon's "Did you like this review" feature--just click yes or no and you're done. No registration, no typing, just click on a link and you're done.</p> <p>I also think the world needs something to expose your passive activities (e.g. surfing from link to link) in a way that helps you build content and maintain privacy&nbsp;without specifically needing to enter something.</p>
