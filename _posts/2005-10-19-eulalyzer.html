End-User License Agreements (EULA) are so common these days that few people, if any, take them seriously. When you want some software, you download it, then you quickly click through all the "I Agree" buttons until you have the software running.  But aren't you worried that there might be a strange clause in there?  You could do a quick search for "firstborn child", or you could use <a href="http://www.javacoolsoftware.com/eulalyzer.html">EULAlyzer</a>.  This free Java applet claims to analyze a EULA for common clauses, flagging those that you might want to read twice.<p>
