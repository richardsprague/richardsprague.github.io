I've been <a href="http://www.ubiomeblog.com/my-ubiome-sleep-hacking-update/">experimenting</a> with the relationship between sleep and resistant starch, taking a few tablespoons of Bob's Red Mill potato starch, which some people think improves sleep by feeding the helpful Bifidobacterium that<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/108/7/3047.long" target="_blank"> may play a role</a> in producing up to 80% of the body's serotonin.<br /><br />There’s no question the potato starch raised my Bifido levels:<br /><img alt="Sprague Bifido over time" border="0" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TDVQ565BjVQ/VTvHg8vJeDI/AAAAAAADBBI/oBdJ2U8iLwA/Pasted_Image_4_25_15__9_52_AM.jpg?imgmax=800" height="157" title="Pasted_Image_4_25_15__9_52_AM.jpg" width="238" /><br /><br />But it seems not to have changed my sleep, either in overall hours:<br /><img alt="Sprague Z vs potato starch" border="0" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hnfsBjBOH-4/VTvHchVHZ5I/AAAAAAADBA4/FmOZ06pPS_s/_var_folders_sl_k2p3_2pj51j64_dz8d3h127h0000gn_T_Rtmp3EtSEz_Preview-becb7e1cca17_html.jpg?imgmax=800" height="199" title="_var_folders_sl_k2p3_2pj51j64_dz8d3h127h0000gn_T_Rtmp3EtSEz_Preview-becb7e1cca17_html.jpg" width="335" /><br />or in a more precise measure, like REM:<br /><img alt="Sprague REM vs potato starch" border="0" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PFGNQvjAuyY/VTvHe-u5G-I/AAAAAAADBBA/Cjab_3exSn0/_var_folders_sl_k2p3_2pj51j64_dz8d3h127h0000gn_T_Rtmp3EtSEz_Preview-becb7e1cca17_html.jpg?imgmax=800" height="204" title="_var_folders_sl_k2p3_2pj51j64_dz8d3h127h0000gn_T_Rtmp3EtSEz_Preview-becb7e1cca17_html.jpg" width="323" /><br />You can see from these charts that I <em>did</em>&nbsp;notice some fantastic nights of sleep after starting potato starch, but there were plenty of other nights when my sleep was back to normal and sometimes worse. If I hadn’t measured so carefully, I’d be tempted to overplay the good and underplay the not-so-good. If there’s a psychosomatic effect, then yeah it may have made me feel better, but in terms of actual sleep time, resistant starch doesn’t seem to have helped.<br />
