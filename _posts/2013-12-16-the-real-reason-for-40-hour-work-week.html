<p>Why do Americans work Monday through Friday and take weekends off?</p> <p>Labor unions say we should thank the rise of organized labor in the early 20th century, whose tireless efforts on behalf of workers forced selfish capitalists to give their employees a break.</p> <p>Henry Ford, in <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/97358938/Henry-Ford-on-the-Economic-Value-of-Leisure">an article</a> published in World’s Work Magazine in 1926, says his company switched from 6-day/48 hours to the modern work week in order to give workers a break. <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/jun/10/food-movement-rising/">Many people</a> still quote Ford as the visionary who paid his workers extra so they could afford to buy his cars. [see <a href="https://ooomf.com/blog/why-you-shouldnt-work-set-hours/">this</a> excellent account from Ooomf, reprinted at <a href="http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2013/12/16/surprising-reason-40-hour-work-week-rethink/?fromcat=all#!p4cbq">TNW</a>]</p> <p>But I have a much simpler explanation: Henry Ford paid his workers more, and gave them weekends off because he didn’t want them to work for his competitors. </p> <p>Google gives its employees free food. Will future labor historians look back and thank the visionary Google management for putting people above profits? Or is it just a clever way to keep employees longer at the office? If you have free food at the office, why go on a networking lunch with somebody from outside?</p> <p>Most employers really do care that their employees have relaxing leisure time, but even if they didn’t, a 40 hour work week is a good idea if for no other reason than to raise the stakes for your competitors.</p><a title="Coal Miner, Detail by cobalt123, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cobalt/2842342447/"><img alt="Coal Miner, Detail" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3057/2842342447_6be1dcbc86_n.jpg" width="280" height="320"></a>
