<p>This month's Wired magazine (June 2008, <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/">not yet available on-line</a>) is an absolute must-read for anyone seriously concerned about global warming and what can really be done about it.&nbsp; The headline summarizes the thinking nicely: keep your SUV, forget organics, go nuclear, screw the spotted owl.&nbsp; Like much of Wired, the title is meant to be provocative, but there is a huge grain of truth that deserves careful thought: all "fixes" have costs, and you better really know what you're doing before you make major changes in the name of "the environment".</p> <p>Meanwhile, I'm following the advice posted yesterday at Crosscut's article "<a href="http://www.crosscut.com/flip-side/14355/Sparing+no+expense+to+reduce+that+carbon+footprint/">Sparing no expense to reduce that carbon footprint</a>".&nbsp; Here's my favorite tip:</p> <blockquote> <p>I often hear the excuse, "With my schedule, I can't be expected to carpool." I say nonsense. Driving produces more than half your carbon footprint. I always ride with at least two people in the car, except on Sundays, when traffic is light and my driver has his day off.</p></blockquote> <p> Hey, every little bit counts.</p>
