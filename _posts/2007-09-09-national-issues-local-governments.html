<p>As I wondered about why non-locals would care about a Mercer Island city council election, one conspiracy theorist pointed me to an article called <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200703/tim-gill">"They Won't Know What Hit Them"</a> in March 2007&nbsp;Atlantic Monthly that describes a brilliant strategy to influence national issues through local elections:</p> <blockquote> <p>Ted Trimpa, who is Colorado’s answer to Karl Rove ...&nbsp;cited the example of Barack Obama: ...&nbsp;It <i>feels good</i> to write him a check. “The temptation is always to swoon for the popular candidate,” Trimpa told me, “but a fraction of that money, directed at the right state and local races, could have flipped a few chambers.</p></blockquote> <p>The idea is for a national organization to encourage its members to send checks, not to national campaigns (where a single contribution won't make much difference) but to local ones where a small donation can make or break an election.&nbsp; Since nation-wide politicians have to start somewhere, you can dramatically affect the future in the long run if you can prevent the opposition from ever getting elected in the first place.</p> <p>A quick glance at the donor list for our election makes it clear that the specific issues in the article don't apply to current Mercer Island elections, but I think it's a great idea and something all political interest groups will do eventually.</p> <p>Incidentally, I'm getting a bunch of&nbsp;emails from both campaigns and&nbsp;while <a href="mailto:richardsprague+home@gmail.com">I'm happy to hear from you directly</a> , I encourage you to please, post to my comments.&nbsp; I'm not intending this to be a political&nbsp;blog and I'm too lazy to check all the facts before summarizing into another post.&nbsp;Go ahead and post anonymously if you like.</p>
