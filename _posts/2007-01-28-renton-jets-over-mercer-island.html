<p></p> <p>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/1998/photorelease/980812.jpg"> </p> <p>The City of Renton&nbsp;is adding a new&nbsp;jet center, attracting new&nbsp;jet traffic to </p> <p>Renton, flying directly over Mercer Island.&nbsp; This would affect the  <p>entire Island, from North to South.  <p>&nbsp; <p>On Monday, January 29, Renton officials will present their plan to  <p>Mercer Island and solicit your comments.&nbsp; It is critical that as many  <p>people as possible attend since this meeting is likely the only  <p>opportunity for Mercer Island citizens to provide input.&nbsp; The meeting  <p>is 7:00 to 9:00pm on January 29th at the Community Center at Mercer  <p>View, 8236 SE 24th Street, MI. </p>
