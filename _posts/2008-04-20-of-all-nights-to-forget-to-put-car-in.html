<p>I woke up to see the neighborhood blanketed with snow.&nbsp; It's April 20th, for crying out loud.</p> <p><a title="Snow on a Prius" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2427461757/"><img height="307" alt="Snow on a Prius" src="http://static.flickr.com/3114/2427461757_9fd4d1c9f7.jpg" width="409" border="0"></a></p> <p>Puh-lease, will somebody turn up the heat?&nbsp; This is making me want to move back to California.</p>
