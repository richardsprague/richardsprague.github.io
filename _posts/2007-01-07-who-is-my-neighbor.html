<p>Our new phonebook arrived today. I can never remember which is the "official" phonebook, because I think Donnelly or somebody makes a competing one. Anyway, this is published by Verizon and comes with an online version at <a href="http://www.superpages.com">http://www.superpages.com</a>.</p> <p>The cool thing about Superpages is that you can easily create&nbsp;a phonebook of just your neighbors.&nbsp; Enter your name and zipcode on the "People Finder" page.&nbsp; After you see the listing,&nbsp;click the option&nbsp;"Find Neighbors" and it shows all the people on your street.&nbsp; Select the "printable" option and it formats it nicely for printing.</p>
