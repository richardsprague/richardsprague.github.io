<p>The biggest problem with all the great new self-measuring tools is the torrent of data they produce. You could devote your life to analyzing your results and not come close to understanding what it all means.</p><p>You’d think this would be a nice business opportunity for a wave of consultants and advice-givers who will take your data and supply meaningful, <em>actionable</em> summaries, but the FDA’s recent <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2013/12/the-fda-needs-to-be-more-bayesian.html">clampdown on 23andme</a> makes this harder than it needs to be. Although automated tools like <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/10/whats-in-my-genes-results-from-23andme.html">Promethease</a> make it a bit easier for the rest of us to do it ourselves,  I’m glad that a few brave companies are stepping into the void — they’re at the cutting edge of something that I think will be commonplace, even routine.</p><p> <a href="http://www.xrgenomics.com/">XRGenemics</a> will send you “the world’s most accurate fitness DNA” kit for £150 (about $250), promising results in about a month.</p><p><a href="https://www.genetrainer.com/">Genetrainer</a> sells a lifetime for $80: give them your 23andme results and they’ll give you a personalized fitness summary, which they’ll keep up-to-date as more science becomes available.</p><p>There are also services that specialize in helping would-be parents figure out the likelihood of potential birth defects. <a href="https://www.counsyl.com/">Counsyl</a> charges $1000, but with many insurance policies the cost can be closer to $300.</p><p>I haven’t tried these services yet — I fortunately don’t have any serious health issues that I want to analyze that deeply — but I’m glad these companies are out there, and I’m looking forward to more new ones in the future.</p>
