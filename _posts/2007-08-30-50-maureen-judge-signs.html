<p>I laughed so hard that my camera phone shook too much to get a good photo:</p><p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1257/1282291145_2be39a4b26.jpg?v=0" /> </p><p>The sign in the middle is one of the Maureen Judge campaign signs, to which some prankster has attached a fake $50 bill. I saw it on my way home this evening at the stop sign on the I-90 exit to East Mercer Way.</p><p>Funny because maybe the prankster knows her campaign is based on <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/08/off-islanders-for-maureen-judge.html">money from people who don't live here</a>, and even funnier because the sign (and prank) wouldn't be there if Maureen had gotten around to cleaning up her mess. It's been a week and a half since the election and apparently she still hasn't had time to come to Mercer Island and put away her signs.</p><p>I wonder if it's considered vandalism to deface a campaign banner? What if the sign has been abandoned?</p><p>Incidentally, several people have written to say I'm being too hard on her -- that she's a smart, highly qualified leader and that her off-island money is just the way local campaigns work for first-time candidates. What do you think?</p><p><em>Update:</em> I received several email comments about this, including this reference to <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002059004_campaignsigns10e.html">an article from the Seattle Times</a>:</p><blockquote>“According to state law, a person may not remove or deface lawfully placed political advertising, including yard signs or billboards, without permission. Knocking over or stealing a sign are both considered third-degree misdemeanors and may carry up to 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine for each count. If a person is found guilty of stealing signs worth $250 or more, collectively, the crime is considered a Class C felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.”</blockquote><p><br /></p>
