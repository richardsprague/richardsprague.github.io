<p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Windemere mailed us their <a href="http://www.windermeremercerisland.com/2007_Year_in_Review_Inside.pdf">Mercer Island 2007 Year in Review</a> (full color, glossy summary of the local housing market) which notes that median sale prices on Mercer Island increased by 12% last year, though have begun to tighten starting in August.&nbsp; This morning Mercer Island Blogger has a <a href="http://mercerislandblogger.wordpress.com/2008/02/12/the-mercer-island-real-estate-market-whats-up/">more up-to-date summary</a> showing how in the last 90 days we've lost 12% -- putting us back where we were a year ago.&nbsp; And meanwhile, Mercer Island is winning (by a large margin) the unscientific Seattle Bubble Blog poll of <a href="http://seattlebubble.com/blog/2008/02/11/poll-which-neighborhood-will-hold-up-best-in-a-downturn/">which neighborhood will hold up best in a downturn</a>.&nbsp; As Windermere concludes:</p> <blockquote> <p>Commute proximity, a strong community, and excellent local schools continue to be Mercer Island's strongest selling points.</p></blockquote> <p>I'm not planning to sell for a while (but go ahead, <a href="http://www.zillow.com/postings/MakeMeMove.htm?s_cid=mmm-site-homeolink">make me an offer</a>!) but one thing I don't understand about the Northwest real estate market is the obsession with offering price.&nbsp; The Windemere brochure goes to the trouble of tracking the "list to sales price ratio", which at 97%, they conclude is healthy. But who cares about the list price?&nbsp; The only price that matters is the selling price.&nbsp; Back in Silicon Valley, one of the most competitive markets in the world, we sold both our houses by listing them at super low-ball prices&nbsp; (outrageously low-ball, like 20% lower than you'd expect) just to get people to come shopping.&nbsp; In both cases we ended up with multiple offers right away -- and a great selling price thanks to the bidding war that results when shoppers who love your house suddenly realize they can pay more than they originally thought.</p> <p>If you're serious about selling your house, why post it for $1.3M -- <a href="http://www.redfin.com/stingray/do/listings-search#residential=true&amp;condo=true&amp;lat=47.56017574678349&amp;long=-122.22808342381909&amp;zoomLevel=11&amp;region_id=11460&amp;region_type=6&amp;market=seattle">Redfin's median price</a> for Mercer Island?&nbsp; Instead, I say, s<a href="http://www.redfin.com/stingray/do/listings-search#residential=true&amp;condo=true&amp;lat=47.56017574678349&amp;long=-122.22808342381909&amp;zoomLevel=11&amp;region_id=11460&amp;region_type=6&amp;market=seattle">tage it impeccably</a>, post it for under $1M, get a ton of traffic from "deal seekers", and watch a flood of people outbid each other to $1.4M.&nbsp; Instead of "honey, we can't afford that place so we're not even going to look at it", you get "okay, fine -- maybe we <em>can</em> afford it if we [borrow some money from your mother|sell some of your jewelry|get another job|etc]"</p>
