<p>Like I said <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2014/10/whats-in-my-microbiome.html">previously</a>, the data (and tools) at the uBiome site are fantastic, and it’s taking me a long time to understand what meaningful conclusions I can make. But first, one basic question I had is how stable the results are. If the microbiota changes all the time, then maybe you can’t really conclude much unless you track long-term trends.</p> <p>In an excellent study <a href="http://genomebiology.com/2014/15/7/R89">published</a> over the summer, Lawrence David at Duke University followed two subjects, measuring their microbiota and zillions of other variables every day for a year. His team concluded that although illness or travel can dramatically change microbiota composition in a single day, and different foods cause levels to fluctuate by up to 15% per day, generally things stay pretty stable.</p> <p>So what happens if I send two samples, taken a few weeks apart, to uBiome? That’s what I tried, keeping close track of exactly what I ate and did in the meantime. </p> <p>Here are the results for the first sample (the one I posted before)</p> <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-Sgsh6uOUMQg/VEGELKrporI/AAAAAAAC708/wWEXiiaxTRw/s1600-h/Image%25255B3%25255D.png"><img title="Image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Image" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-jEhqpfrl5qg/VEGENR42YbI/AAAAAAAC71E/Iqy0Sp6vkjw/Image_thumb%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="419" height="220"></a></p> <p>Here’s the newer sample, taken three weeks later:</p> <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-4q9jFdZs0lc/VEGEO2xVzLI/AAAAAAAC71M/d0oRmRtCPFo/s1600-h/Image%25255B7%25255D.png"><img title="Image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-ZQMC9FHapw8/VEGEQ7ePFEI/AAAAAAAC71U/qk4y0PscP6A/Image_thumb%25255B3%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="421" height="223"></a></p> <p>Hmmm. As you can see, these results seem quite different – far more than the 15% daily fluctuation from the Lawrence study.</p> <p>No special travel or other unusual activity during those three weeks. Nothing unusual in my diet. I’m still analyzing what I ate, but for example here’s the amount of fiber per day, starting the week before the first test.</p> <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-MJ0bpc8Zi3I/VEGESvKKaHI/AAAAAAAC71c/S0nNCVG9FPE/s1600-h/image%25255B12%25255D.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-8sL0nXtGB-E/VEGEUVS-juI/AAAAAAAC71k/ZXuxP3tWpkM/image_thumb%25255B6%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="423" height="299"></a></p> <p>Nothing super unusual there. Note that I am a completely healthy male, normal/stable weight, no history of anything. Last antibiotic use was <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2011/10/what-happened-to-me.html">a long time</a> ago. </p> <p>Incidentally, <a href="http://twitter.com/thsaey">Tina Saey (@thsaey)</a> sent the same sample to two labs (uBiome plus <a href="http://humanfoodproject.com/americangut/">American Gut Project</a>), and got <a href="http://mrheisenbug.wordpress.com/2014/04/24/dear-american-gut-ubiome-you-have-some-explaining-to-do/">dramatically different</a> results. uBiome wrote a <a href="http://www.ubiomeblog.com/american-gut-and-ubiome-data/">detailed response</a> – my takeway was that the differences can be mostly explained by how each lab handles the samples but that you can correct for that (mostly). </p> <p>Still more analysis ahead of me. Meanwhile, I’ve sent them a third sample to compare further.</p>
