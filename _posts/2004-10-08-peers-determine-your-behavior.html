<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB109717844208239500,00.html?mod=todays_us_marketplace">WSJ.com - Science Journal</a>: discusses how "the National Science Foundation gave anthropologist Scott Atran, a research director at the National Center for Scientific Research, Paris, emergency funding to study groups that sponsor suicide attacks".
