<p>If you’re trying to find me, and you looked at this blog hoping for some updates, you’ve been disappointed.&#160; </p>  <p>I’m still updating, even more frequently than before, but on <a href="http://twitter.com/sprague/">Twitter</a>. I’ve found the <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2009/03/twitter-helps-lazy-people-express.html">140-char limitation there to be liberating</a>, more in tune with the short snippets of attention that I typically can afford most updates.</p>  <p>That said, I have a lot to say, and Twitter is beginning to feel too short. I’m not sure exactly how to replace it, and I suspect this blog may be part of it, if I can figure out how to organize my thoughts in a way that make sense to have on a single web site. </p>  <p>It’s complicated, though, because of the many faces of me. If you’re looking for personal updates, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/richardsprague/">Facebook</a>’s a better medium.&#160; If you want professional information, see me on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/sprague">LinkedIn</a>. But where do I put the rest of me, the hodgepodge of interests I have in technology, <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/">Hayek</a>, China, <a href="http://imercerisland.com/">Mercer Island</a>, and more?</p>  <p>I’m still waiting to figure that out. But meanwhile don’t go away.</p>
