<p>Several months ago I found myself behind a gravel truck on the freeway, and before I could maneuver out of the way a tiny pebble flipped onto my windshield and gave me a tiny crack.&#160; It was just big enough to be annoying, but not big enough to justify replacing the entire windshield.&#160; For several months I just lived with it, but it bothered me because I’ve heard that it weakens the glass and can cause more serious problems later if you don’t take care of it.</p>  <p>Fortunately I discovered that there are several cheap solutions, all covered by my auto insurance.&#160; <a href="http://www.windshields.com/">Windshields.com</a> will give you a summary of the options in your area, customized to your car make and model.&#160; In my case, there weren’t any locations close enough to bother, but I found that my local Jiffy Lube will do it too, while I wait.</p>  <p>Although the cost is covered by insurance, I was apprehensive about fixing it. Wouldn’t they raise my rates? My insurance company (Amica) said they don’t.&#160; Leaving it unrepaired exposes me to potentially more serious damage later, and besides, the cost to fix it is pretty minimal. </p>  <p>A professional auto glass place will charge everything to insurance, so it’s actually cheaper than Jiffy Lube, which makes me pay $5 as a convenience fee.&#160; But finding an auto glass place and scheduling an appointment is too much hassle, so Jiffy Lube it was.&#160; And it really was fast: they had the glass repaired and I was out of there in 15 minutes.</p>  <p>They don’t actually replace the windshield.&#160; They basically just squirt some special glue into the crack to seal it and prevent further damage.&#160; Although supposedly this makes the glass about as safe as a full replacement, you can still see evidence of a crack, so it’s not a perfect solution.</p>  <p>Here’s how it works: the technician first cleans the hole, by drilling it carefully.&#160; Then he uses a special vise to “pull” the windshield glass in such a way that the crack opens enough to fill it thoroughly with the glue.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><a title="IMG_9717" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/3595529541/"><img height="284" alt="IMG_9717" src="http://static.flickr.com/3381/3595529541_395b2150f7.jpg" width="378" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>The glue is essentially a special transparent resin that seals the glass and prevents further damage.</p>  <p><img height="240" alt="IMG_9718" src="http://static.flickr.com/3605/3596338322_c39220b347.jpg" width="180" border="0" /></p>  <p>You can’t use this process for cracks longer than 6 inches, but for marks like mine it seems just perfect.</p>
