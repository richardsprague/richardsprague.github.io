The NYTimes has an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/19/opinion/19barton.html">opinion piece</a> by Frederick Barton and Bathsheba Crocker from the Post-Conflict Reconstruction Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  They suggest holding a referendum where we ask the Iraqis themselves whether they want the U.S. to leave immediately, or not.<br /><br />I like that idea!  One additional spin they don't mention is that you could hold the referendum along with the parliamentary elections. It would give the insurgents who oppose the elections a reason to boost voter turnout.<br /><br />
