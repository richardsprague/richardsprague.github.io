<p>Late last Summer at my annual physical, my doctor tested my Vitamin D levels and found that, like most residents of the Northwest, <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/09/my-vitamin-d-shortage.html" target="_blank">I was well below optimal</a>—only 16.2 nl/ML in my case.&#160; Since then, I began taking Vitamin D3 supplements to the tune of between 2000 and 4000 I.U. per day.&#160; Basically, this means I pop two pills in the morning and another one or two in the evening.</p>  <p>Well, I’m happy to report that this week I had my levels tested again and I’m now up to a healthy&#160; 52.0 nl/ML.&#160; Since the ideal range is between 32 and 100, I’m not going to bother increasing my dose.&#160; By the way, although the test was covered by my insurance, the normal price for the test is $150 – outrageous!</p>  <p>I found that I was able to get good results by taking relatively cheap supplements purchased at Costco&#160; for something like $10 for a bottle of 300 (on the left in this photo).&#160; Lately I’ve been trying the drop version (on the right, below) which is about the same price but takes up less space.</p>  <p><a title="Vitamin D pills" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/3329452229/"><img alt="Vitamin D pills" src="http://static.flickr.com/3325/3329452229_153e92fe10.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>Maybe it’s just a coincidence, and knock on wood and all that, but I haven’t had any colds or flu or any other significant sickness since last summer.&#160; We’ll see if that lasts, but I’m pretty convinced this is a good idea when you live in an area without much sunshine.</p>
