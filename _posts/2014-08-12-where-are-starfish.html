<p>We’re on vacation this week in Coastal Maine, and yesterday at low tide we saw this on a beach south of Belfast:</p><p><img title="BelfastStarfish1.jpg" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-dv2SSB5jyl0/U-n2V_hbzNI/AAAAAAAC424/vF-D76SHRvk/BelfastStarfish1.jpg?imgmax=800" alt="Healthy Starfish near Belfast, Maine" width="450" height="600" border="0" /></p><p>Sadly, west coast starfish are victims of some kind of <a href="http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/09/09/massive-starfish-die-off-baffles-scientists/">unexplained population collapse.</a> There’s even an <a href="http://www.inaturalist.org/projects/pisaster-disaster-tracking-starfish-wasting-disease">iNaturalist project</a> to track deaths from the “starfish wasting disease”. Nobody is sure about the cause, though of course everyone’s first guess revolves around the usual suspects: pollution, climate change, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">George Bush</span> the Koch Brothers. As a non-expert, I think it’s interesting that the population crash apparently follows a similarly-unexplained population explosion a few years ago, so I wonder if it’s just the normal cycle of life.</p><p>I thought this was limited to the West Coast, but apparently there are <a href="http://metronews.ca/news/canada/816907/experts-investigate-massive-sea-star-die-off-near-b-c/">scientists worried about the same thing</a> on the Atlantic. Glad to see that not <em>all</em> starfish are affected, at least not yet.</p><p> </p>
