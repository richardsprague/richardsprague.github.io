The recent book Freakonomics popularized the thesis that <a href="http://islandia.law.yale.edu/donohue/Donohue%20and%20Levitt%20(2001).pdf">legalized abortion explains much of the drop in crime </a>that began right when the first descendents of Roe v. Wade would have hit their unruly teenage years.<br /><br />James Taranto of the Wall Street Journal claims the same effect is reponsible for<a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110006913"> more Republican voters</a> over time. Not only are abortions performed more among traditionally Democratic groups (thus over time resulting in proportionally fewer blacks, hispanics, and other pro-Democratic constituencies), common sense indicates that children generally are more likely to grow up voting similarly to their parents.  If those children were never born in the first place, they'll never vote.<br /><br /><br />
