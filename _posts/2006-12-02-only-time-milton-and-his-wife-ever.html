<p>Milton Friedman was married to his wife, Rose, for 68 years (!) and when&nbsp;he died last week was <a href="http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_RPTPJNV">eulogised by the Economist</a> as the "most influential economist of the second half of the 20th century (Keynes died in 1946), possibly of all of it".&nbsp; Of course, when two people have been married so long, you really can't credit just one of them for anything -- they were clearly a team, and should be assigned co-authorship to everything they did.</p> <p><img src="http://www.dallasfed.org/news/research/2003/ftcp/images/ftc10.jpg"> </p> <p>Which is why it's interesting to see <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110008690">this interview</a> they gave to the WSJ last year, talking about Iraq:</p> <blockquote> <p>Mr. Friedman here shifted focus. "What's really killed the Republican Party isn't spending, it's Iraq. As it happens, <strong>I was opposed to going into Iraq from the beginning</strong>. I think it was a mistake, for the simple reason that I do not believe the United States of America ought to be involved in aggression." Mrs. Friedman--listening to her husband with an ear cocked--was now muttering darkly. </p> <p><i>Milton:</i> "Huh? What?" <i>Rose: </i>"This was not aggression!" <i>Milton (exasperatedly):</i> "It <i>was</i> aggression. Of course it was!" <i>Rose:</i> "You count it as aggression if it's against the people, not against the monster who's ruling them. We don't agree. <strong>This is the first thing to come along in our lives, of the deep things, that we don't agree on</strong>. We have disagreed on little things, obviously--such as, I don't want to go out to dinner, he wants to go out--but big issues, this is the first one!" <i>Milton:</i> "But, having said that, once we went in to Iraq, it seems to me very important that we make a success of it." <i>Rose:</i> "And we will!"</p></blockquote> <p>(The WSJ concludes by noting that Mrs. Friedman had the last word) <p>[via <a href="http://truckandbarter.com/mt/archives/2006/11/milton_friedman.html">trunkandbarter</a> and <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/2006/11/25/if-barack-obama-is-as-good-a-politician-as-he-is-a-writer-he-will-soon-be-president/">freakonomics</a>] <p>p.s. Bonus factoid:&nbsp; Milton was a well-known Reagan fan, but guess who he supported as Reagan's successor?&nbsp; Donald Rumsfeld&nbsp;(!) [according to <a href="http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_RPTPJNV">the Economist</a> ]
