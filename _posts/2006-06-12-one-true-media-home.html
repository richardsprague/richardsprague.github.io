<a href="http://www.onetruemedia.com/otm_site/public_home">One True Media Home</a><br /><br />OneTrueMedia.com is a Kleiner-Perkins-backed startup with an interesting idea: let people edit their videos on line. This is one of those potentially good ideas where everything is about execution. If they make it easy and useful, then it could be very successful; if it’s just another upload-and-wait site, then who cares. I haven’t tried it yet, but I’ve added it to my del.icio.us watchlist.
