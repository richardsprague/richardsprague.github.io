This suggestion from a Slashdot article I read in the context of IBM's announcement today:
<br />
<br />
<br /><a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/09/13/1058241">Slashdot | IBM to Open Voice Recognition Software</a>: "For those of you who haven't read it, check out <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/catalog/guide_xml.asp?isbn=0066620678">The Unfinished Revolution </a>[harpercollins.com] by Michael Dertouzos. I don't agree with all of his analysis (he was a little lacking in pragmatism on some points), but overall this book was very insightful. This book, along with Weaving the Web [w3.org] by Tim Berners-Lee, caused a big paradigm shift in my thinking about computer technology."
