<p>An oenophile friend bought a place near Zillah to grow grapes and make their own wine. Is it legal for them to give some to us? <p>It appears the answer is no:  <p>Here are the rules, from Washington Revised Code <a href="http://www.beertown.org/statutes/washington.htm">Title 66, Chapter 66.12, ยง66.12.010</a>: <ol> <li>An adult member of a household may remove family wine from the home for exhibition or use at organized wine tastings or competitions, subject to the following conditions: <br>(a) The quantity removed by a producer for these purposes is limited to a quantity not exceeding one gallon; <br>(b) Family wine is not removed for sale or for the use of any person other than the producer. </li></ol> <p>I also <a href="http://www.beertown.org/index.html">checked the rules</a> for a few other states. In <a href="http://www.beertown.org/statutes/newhampshire.htm">New Hampshire</a>, for example, the law is unclear about whether it's okay to make your own beer or not. <p>[Slate has a nice summary about&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2176247/fr/flyout">home brew alcohol</a>]</p>
