<p>I'm always <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/12/mercer-island-schools-don-make-gold.html">interested in school rankings</a>, since competition is the only way to be sure your school is performing as well as it could be.&nbsp; <a href="http://reportcard.ospi.k12.wa.us/SideBySide.aspx?schoolId=1&amp;OrgTypeId=1&amp;reportLevel=State&amp;orgLinkId=">Here's another site</a> for evaluating public schools, this one run by the Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction [and discussed today on <a href="http://www.crosscut.com/k-12/13406/Washington+schools+report+card%3A+A+way+to+grade+your+child%27s+school/">Crosscut</a>].</p> <p>I immediately compared the three Mercer Island elementary schools, not expecting to see anything new since the data is the same public info that is published in the paper and elsewhere, but I was surprised to see that Lakeridge had by far the lowest number of years of teacher experience.&nbsp; At 8 years, the average Lakeridge teacher has less experience than either West Mercer (13 years) or Island Park (16).&nbsp; All three schools are roughly the same on most everything else (including the percentage of teachers with masters degree -- about 2/3rds, wow!)</p>
