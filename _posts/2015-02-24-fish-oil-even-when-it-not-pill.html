<p>An interesting result when I measured my BRT today:</p><p>Note how today’s result was noticeably higher than for the past few days.</p><p> </p><p><img title="salmonBRTResults.jpg" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-tn98GnFk3rU/VOz95l5G-AI/AAAAAAAC-3w/_xkph_bsx0M/salmonBRTResults.jpg?imgmax=800" alt="BRT after eating salmon" width="400" height="293" border="0" /></p><p> </p><p>I've been traveling, and I didn't have any fish oil pills, so it was odd that today's result was so much better than previous days. Was there something unusual in my diet or activity in the past 24-48 hours?</p><p>I looked back over my last couple of days eating/exercise/etc and remembered I had salmon last night for dinner.</p><p><a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2015/02/fish-oil-makes-me-smarter.html">Bingo</a>.</p><p>This is an especially interesting result because it was entirely unexpected. I didn’t know to look for this until <em>after</em> I saw the results of the test.</p>
