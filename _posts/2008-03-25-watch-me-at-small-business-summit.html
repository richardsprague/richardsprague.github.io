<p>I'm doing a demo of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/responsepoint">Response Point</a>, the super-easy phone system for small businesses, this morning (Tuesday) March 24th at the <a href="https://www.sbsummit.com/Default.aspx">SB Summit web cast</a>.</p> <p>It's free, and the easiest way to watch is to follow the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mssmallbiz/archive/2008/03/24/8333513.aspx">streaming video on the SMB Community Blog</a> site.&nbsp; Tune in between 10 and 11am (PST) on Tuesday morning, toward the last part of the hour, when I'll be doing a segment called "Phone it in".</p> <p><em>update</em>: <a href="http://allenmillercomputerconsulting.blogspot.com/2008/03/richard-sprague-small-business-summit.html">Allen Miller just posted a downloadable</a> version that you can watch any time.</p>
