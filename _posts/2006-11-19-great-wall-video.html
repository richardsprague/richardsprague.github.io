<p>&nbsp;Here's a video from my trip to China last week.&nbsp; I went with my boss and another engineer to the Great Wall, at Mutianyu.&nbsp; Most people go to a slightly closer location of the Wall, so this one is less crowded with tourists. One fun part is that you can ride a toboggan on the way down.&nbsp; I snuck a video camera for the ride, though I had to shut it off early when one of the guards started to yell "no photo".&nbsp;</p><embed pluginspage="http://macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" src="http://soapbox.msn.com/flash/soapbox1_1.swf" width="412" height="362" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" quality="high" wmode="transparent" flashvars="c=v&amp;v=8b24415e-9ec6-472a-88fe-9acdb7f74f4b"></embed><br><a title="Great Wall of China" href="http://soapbox.msn.com/video.aspx?vid=8b24415e-9ec6-472a-88fe-9acdb7f74f4b" target="_new">Video: Great Wall of China</a>
