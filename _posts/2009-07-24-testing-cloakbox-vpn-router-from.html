<p>The internet is a chaotic place, where packets of information swim all over the world, ready to be scooped up, peered at, or blocked by anyone (or any government).&#160; To be truly secure, and to own your own channel in that ocean of data, you need a Virtual Private Network (VPN) that encrypts everything and ensures that the rest of the internet will see only what you want them to see.&#160; Companies operate VPNs all the time, but consumers have the same ability thanks to a plethora of services from companies like <a href="http://www.witopia.net/">Witopia</a>, who I chose for the VPN I set up this week at home.</p>  <p>The Witopia Cloakbox costs $199, a lot more than the $50 or so you’ll pay for a Linksys, but it includes one year of VPN service. On the outside it looks just like a regular Cisco Linksys router. In fact, the model number (WRT54GL) is the same as the Wireless-G router I’ve been using at home for years. Everything is so similar that at first I wondered if there’d been a mistake. The photos on the web site made me think the box would look distinctive somehow—maybe bright orange—but it’s not.</p>  <p>Setting up was trivial. I plugged it in and it just worked. I just substituted the plugs and cables from my previous router, and everything swapped over without change. Then I turned it on and it all worked.&#160; The wireless features are disabled by default, but Witopia operates a Wiki site with easy-to-understand instructions for how to get that going, and I had my household wireless network running minutes after opening the box.</p>  <p>Upon starting up, I <a href="http://en.utrace.de/">checked my IP address</a> and (cool!) it thought I was in Kansas!&#160; This is convenient because (1) it means I can access web sites (like iTunes) that restrict non-US users, and (2) any government-run site-blocking service won’t work because as far as the internet is concerned, I’m located in the United States.</p>  <p>Next, I checked my access speed. This was a little disappointing.&#160; All that hopping around causes an exceptionally long ping time.&#160; Here’s what my speed test shows when I run my computer using my regular (non-VPN) router from my home near Seattle:</p>  <p><a title="speedtest1" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/3752963913/"><img border="0" alt="speedtest1" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2616/3752963913_1551f5b671.jpg" width="375" height="276" /></a></p>  <p>And here’s what it looks like with the Cloakbox:</p>  <p><a title="speedtestVPN1" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/3753760664/"><img border="0" alt="speedtestVPN1" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2625/3753760664_43915bdb73.jpg" width="391" height="290" /></a></p>  <p>The results change slightly each time I run the test, but these were the best times I was able to get for each version.&#160; As you can see, the Clockbox VPN gives me about 1Mbps slower download speed, and a much longer ping time (160-300ms versus 40-70).</p>  <p>Overall I’m very pleased at how easy it was to set up.&#160; Although the speeds are slower, I think it will be manageable, and of course nothing can beat the convenience of being able to surf the internet securely and without restrictions.</p>  <p>But how well does it really work?&#160; For that you’ll have to wait for future posts from this blog.&#160; In a few days, I’ll be living in China, but if the internet thinks I’m in Kansas, you’ll know it’s working.</p>
