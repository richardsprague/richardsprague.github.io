<p>The Atlantic has <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/10/are-private-schools-worth-it/280693/">a short interview</a> with University of Illinois - Urbana-Champaign professors Sarah Theule Lubienski, and her husband Christopher A. Lubienski: “a new book argues that public schools are actually academically superior”.</p> <p>I don’t have the book (<a title="The Public School Advantage- Why Public Schools Outperform Private Schools" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/022608891X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=022608891X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=richasprag-20">The Public School Advantage- Why Public Schools Outperform Private Schools</a> to be published in November 2013), but the authors <a href="http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/HE/mf_OP111.pdf">wrote a 2006 paper</a> that seems to conclude the same thing. Essentially they use a large dataset to argue that, while private schools do outperform public schools overall, the advantage disappears when you account for demographics of the students.</p> <p>This would indeed be interesting if it were true. But a quick look at the paper makes me wonder about some obvious mistakes in methodology behind the&nbsp; headline-grabbing “conclusion”.</p> <ul> <li>150K public students (96%) vs. 6500 private students (4%)</li> <li>2K Catholic, 2K charter, 1K “Christian”</li> <li>Of 6,000 schools overall, only 150 are “other private”.</li></ul> <p>Since almost all of their data from private schools is from religious schools (mostly Catholic), shouldn’t <em>that</em> be the headline? This is NOT comparing your local school with the $20K/year highly-selective boarding school that many people imagine when they think “private school”.&nbsp; As the study itself points out, there are many reasons parents might shell out extra money to send their kids to a school, but religion is a big one that, if anything, would trump "academics” in a lot of cases.</p> <p>As always, my conclusion is to wonder how useful it is to know <em>in aggregate</em> whether something as variable as education is better done one way or another. What matters is what’s good for <em>your</em> kid. Trying to make a generalization about education systems based on a database of thousands of schools is like trying to predict the value of your home by looking at trends in US real estate. Who cares? </p>
