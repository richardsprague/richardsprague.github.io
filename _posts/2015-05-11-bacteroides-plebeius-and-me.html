<p> Japanese people are able to digest sushi better than other people <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100407/full/news.2010.169.html">thanks to enzymes in Bacteroides plebeius</a>, a bacterium that was first discovered in 2005 and later <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7290/full/nature08937.html">found to be common</a> in Japanese guts. The<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7290/full/nature08937.html#B7"> 2010 paper in </a><em>Nature</em> that analyzed this could find no non-Japanese who harbored it, providing <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125675700">some speculation</a> that the microbe has co-evolved with Japanese people, perhaps over thousands of years, to let them digest carbohydrates present in the nori seaweed that wraps the sushi.</p><p>Well, I appear to be an exception, according to my uBiome results. I don’t have any Japanese ancestry, but I <em>do</em> have a ton of <em>B. plebeius, </em>an incredible 16% of all the species identified in my October sample. (uBiome was only able to identify about 65% of the species present, so 16% is quite high).</p><p>This doesn’t seem to be a fluke in the uBiome data. After seeing <a href="https://github.com/richardsprague/uBiome">my free RuBiome tools</a>, many people have sent me their own uBiome results, but of the dozen or so I’ve analyzed, none of them (all North Americans, like me) have any <em>B. plebeius. </em>If the uBiome test didn’t accurately identify this species, I’d expect at least <em>some</em> of these other users to find in it in their guts too.  Nope, I appear to be unique.</p><p>The obvious answer is that I picked it up sometime during the ten years <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2014/05/maybe-japan-is-not-really-lost.html">I lived in Tokyo</a> during the 1980s and 90s. I love eating new things, and I certainly ate my share of raw konbu and other types of seaweed. Guess I must have brought home more than just the memories of good meals.</p><p>I don’t eat nearly as much sushi and seaweed as I used to, though my kids and I enjoy good, high-quality Japanese <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0093ZTUEA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0093ZTUEA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=richasprag-20&amp;linkId=LVLBHBGBLDQZ5P4K"><em>koshihikari</em> rice</a> a few times each week, often wrapped with toasted nori. That’s probably not as good for my <em>plebeius</em> as the raw stuff, and come to think of it, my latest February uBIome results show much lower amounts: down to less than 1%.</p><p> Okay, I know what’s on my shopping list the next time I’m at a Japanese grocery.</p><p><a title="2011-05-23%2017.58.32 by Mike Linksvayer, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mlinksva/5754120066"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5108/5754120066_d4da8180a6.jpg" alt="2011-05-23%2017.58.32" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
