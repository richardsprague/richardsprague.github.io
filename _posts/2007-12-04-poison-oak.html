<p>For me, it was an annoying couple of pimples on my hand.&nbsp; Itched a lot, but nothing to get worried about.&nbsp; My eight<strike>ten</strike>-year-old, though, broke out in a rash all over his face, with splotches on his leg and chest -- serious enough that we went to the dermatologist today.&nbsp; Diagnosis: an allergic response to urushiol, the active ingredient in <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicodendron_diversilobum">Toxicodendron diversilobum</a></em>, more commonly known as poison oak, no doubt from our trips through the woods <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/11/moonlight-at-hood-canal.html">last week at Hood Canal</a>.</p> <p>Click <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2292/2087754274_a97e617cff.jpg?v=0">here</a> for a photo of my hand (nothing too gross, I promise) and a reminder to be careful on hikes: "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicodendron_diversilobum">leaves of three -- let it be</a>."</p> <p><img height="288" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Poisonoak.jpg" width="438"> </p> <p>Update on additional facts I've learned:</p> <ul> <li>Urushiol can remain active for months, so multiple after-exposures are possible if you don't wash (with detergent) everything that came in contact with the plant.&nbsp; Apparently urishiol is easy to spot on an object, though: it oxidizes into a blackish lacquer upon exposure to air.  <li>Allergic reaction seldom occurs on the first exposure. The second exposure is the one to watch for, because the reaction can be quite severe.&nbsp; You can lose your sensitivity entirely if you are exposed often enough.  <li>People who are allergic are super-allergic. In one test, people developed a reaction after a thumb was pressed on the back of a non-allergic person who had been exposed three days earlier!  <li>The best article I found is <a href="http://www.pesgce.com/toxicodendrondermatitis/derm.asp">here</a>.&nbsp; </li></ul>
