You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.
# Ellis Clark

Remarkably consistent across all four samples.  The top items are mostly the same at the phlyum and even genus level.

* **Akkermanisia** is missing in the final two samples (Jul, Sep).  I wonder if there was a major event (change of diet, location?)
* Genus **Clostridium** was very high in March but has decreased considerably. Since this is often associated with pathogens, this is a good trend.
* Increasing **Roseburia** is also a good trend.

You have to keep in mind that sampling differences can be quite large. In my experience, a "well-blended" sample contains the same taxa as a single-swab one, but the amounts will vary

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
