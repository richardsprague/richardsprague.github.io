<a href="http://www.wunderground.com/stationmaps/gmap.asp?zip=98040&wmo=99999">Weather Underground </a>uses Google Maps to show you the weather conditions locally, with pushpins in each location that publishes weather from your area.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately a search on Mercer Island doesn't include the weather station at St. Monica's High School (or any other Island location).
