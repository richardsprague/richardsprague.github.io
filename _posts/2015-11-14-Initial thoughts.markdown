Remarkably consistent across all four samples.  The top items are mostly the same at the phlyum and even genus level.

* Genu **Akkermanisia** is missing in the final two samples (Jul, Sep).  I wonder if there was a major event (change of diet, location?)
* Genus **Clostridium** was very high in March but has decreased considerably. Since this is often associated with pathogens, this is a good trend.
* Increasing **Roseburia** is also a good trend.

You have to keep in mind that sampling differences can be quite large. In my experience, a "well-blended" sample contains the same taxa as a single-swab one, but the amounts will vary, possibly by a lot.
