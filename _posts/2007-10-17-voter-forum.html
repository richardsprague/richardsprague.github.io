<p>Much as I wish I could have attended all of tonight's <a href="http://www.seattlelwv.org/node/512">Mercer Island Voter Forum</a>, my day job has kept me far too busy lately and I had to rush home. It was nice to see a few familiar faces, especially&nbsp;Steve Litzow, who agreed to be <a href="http://www.facebook.com/p/Richard_Sprague/218509">my friend on Facebook</a>!</p> <p>I heard the best soundbite was from <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/10/democratic-candidate-maureen-judge.html">Maureen Judge</a>, who promised to fight for us from Olympia.&nbsp; But what else?&nbsp; If you attended, please pile on in the comments of this post and let us know what you thought.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2305/1610088552_66dab73396.jpg?v=0"></p>
