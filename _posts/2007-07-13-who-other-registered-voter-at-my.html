<p>Sound Politics runs an online tool to <a href="http://www.soundpolitics.com/voterlookup.html">look up registered voters in Washington State</a>.&nbsp; They show three people registered at my address: my wife and I, plus...who is this other guy?&nbsp; A total stranger, somebody not listed in the phone book.</p> <p>That <a href="http://usefulwork.com/cgi-bin/wavoterdb.cgi?last=ADHAHN&amp;first=&amp;county=All Counties&amp;submitName&amp;sortby=prename">convicted sex offender</a> who killed that 12-year-old Tacoma girl is a registered voter too.&nbsp; And, he's wanted on immigration charges -- so he's not a U.S. citizen?&nbsp; What gives?</p> <p>Thank goodness&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2007/3/15/133452/646">voter fraud is just an illusion</a> concocted by Republicans to justify their loss in our last gubernatorial election.</p> <p>Check it out: who else is using your address to vote?&nbsp;</p>
