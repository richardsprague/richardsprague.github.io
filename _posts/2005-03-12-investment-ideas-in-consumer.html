Here's my Big Bet: iPod will not be the dominant music player in five years. I'm not sure who will replace them or how, but this market will have a lot of volatility.<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.forbes.com/markets/2005/03/10/0310automarketscan11.html">NAPS</a>: a pure-play digital subscription service.  Current stock price is around 7, significantly down from its high of about 10 a few months ago. </li><br /><li><a href="http://online.barrons.com/article/SB110756795416346642.html?mod=b_this_weeks_magazine_main">RNWK </a>is priced very low (about $6), partly because of the competition from Apple and Microsoft.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.forbes.com/markets/2005/02/23/0223automarketscan12.html">PLAY </a>makes the chipset used in the iPod. At $26, they're off from their post-IPO highs in the low-30s in November. These guys are <a href="http://yahoo.businessweek.com/technology/content/oct2004/tc20041020_7910.htm">controversial </a>because of the short-term nature of their contract with Apple. I wouldn't touch them unless I understand a bit more about their technology. Are they in Apple because of some fluke? or do they have special non-imitatable technology?</li><br /></ul><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
