<p>On my long and dangerous journey through snow to Seatac this morning, I swung into <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2005/07/debunking-super-size-me_08.html" target="_blank">McDonalds</a> to try those <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com.au/HTML/ourFood/mccafe.asp" target="_blank">new coffee beverages</a> theyâ€™ve been advertising.&#160; They give out these free latte coupons that expire December 31st, so I had to try it soon.&#160; Yuk.&#160; It tasted like Folgers with hot milk.&#160; On a cold snowy day it was definitely worth the free coupon, but not much more.</p>  <p><a title="McCafe" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/3126878896/"><img alt="McCafe" src="http://static.flickr.com/3296/3126878896_b9299a5171.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>
