My presentation at the July meeting of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Quantified-Self-Seattle/events/223265378/" target="_blank">Quantified Self Seattle</a>, with more details about the A/B experiment <a href="http://www.ubiomeblog.com/one-week-change-in-my-microbiome/">I wrote about on the uBiome blog</a>.<br /><br /><iframe frameborder="0" height="400" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/erXLaqWNuMU2ca" width="476"></iframe><br />As always the best part of these presentations is the question and answer period, and the mingling that happens long after the formal talk. I met several people who gave me their own microbiome data right on the spot, and I was able to quickly analyze them with my uBiome tools.<br /><br />One of the attendees told me about his own potato starch experiments and how it had dramatically improved his sleep, <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2015/04/potato-starch-doesnt-help-my-sleep_25.html">contrary to what I found for myself</a>. The difference, we discovered, is in amounts: he uses only a teaspoon a day, much less than the 2-4 <em>tablespoons</em>&nbsp;I had been trying. I canâ€™t wait to try a smaller dose to see if I can get the same great effect.
