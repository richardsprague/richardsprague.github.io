<p>We spent our Thanksgiving in a remote cabin north of Tahuya, facing Hood Canal.&nbsp;Last&nbsp;night we stayed up late to catch the low tide, which turned out to be <em>very</em> low,&nbsp;&nbsp;with the beach and the mountains beyond&nbsp;lit brightly by a moon at perigee.&nbsp; You would not believe the zillions of starfish we saw -- one every square foot at least -- most of them feasting on oysters. Very nice place, and less than two hours from Seattle.&nbsp; Of course, maybe it was the perfect weather that made it so pleasant, but it was good to be away from civilization for a while.</p> <p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2336/2062026614_4340b6ff5b.jpg?v=0"></p>
