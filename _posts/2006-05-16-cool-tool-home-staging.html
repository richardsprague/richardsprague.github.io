My favorite advice site, <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001235.php">Cool Tools, reviews a book about Home Staging</a>. 212 pages of suggestions for how to make sure your house is fit to sell.  For example: replace all worn carpet now--buyers don't want to go through the effort of guessing what it will look like with new carpet, even if they intend to replace it later.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/homestaging_web.jpg" /><br />I'm not interested in selling anytime soon, but someday I'm sure I'll move again and I hope the people who own my next house don't bother following the advice from this book.
