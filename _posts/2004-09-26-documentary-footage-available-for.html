The guy who made that Anti-Bush movie about Fox News is putting footage he collected for the film <a href="http://www.jimgilliam.com/2004/09/outfoxed_interviews_available_for_remixing.php">online for remixing</a>.  He uses the Creative Commons license to enable normal people to download 48 minutes of his source interviews, and he encourages you to edit them yourselves.

<br />Welcome to the next wave of news collecting.
