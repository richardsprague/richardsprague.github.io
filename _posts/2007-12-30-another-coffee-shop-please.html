<p>Mercer Island enjoys plenty of nice coffee outlets, but why do I have to drive to Seattle for the <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/11/clover-coffee.html">really good stuff</a>?</p> <p><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2180301/pagenum/2/">Slate</a> this week makes a good case for why Starbucks actually helps mom-and-pop coffee houses:</p> <blockquote> <p>According to recent figures from the Specialty Coffee Association of America, 57 percent of the nation's coffeehouses are still mom and pops. Just over the five-year period from 2000 to 2005—long after Starbucks supposedly obliterated indie cafes—the number of mom and pops grew 40 percent, from 9,800 to nearly 14,000 coffeehouses.</p></blockquote> <p>There are so many great ways that a local coffee house can differentiate itself on Mercer Island.</p> <ul> <li>Exotic varietals in small batches that Starbucks, with its huge volume requirements, can't match.  <li>In-store roasting: talk about fresh.  <li><a href="http://cloverequipment.com/home/Default.aspx">Clover</a> coffee machines (your $11k investment will quickly repay itself)  <li>Free internet access&nbsp; (Starbucks makes you pay)  <li>Kid-friendly areas so the kids can occupy themselves while Mom chats with her friends.  <li>In-store meeting rooms, available by reservation for group meet-ups.</li></ul> <p>David Schomer from Seattle's <a href="http://www.espressovivace.com/">Espresso Vivace</a> has many more tips in his excellent guide to <a href="http://www.espressovivace.com/archives/lucidcafe/LC28.pdf">how to compete with Starbucks</a>.&nbsp; And all of this is especially true for a Mercer Island location, given our proximity to the world's finest roasters and more in Seattle.</p> <p>The margins on coffee are ridiculously high.&nbsp; A mom-and-pop operation could even compete on price -- undercharge Starbucks, at least on basic items -- and still make be profitable.&nbsp; Mercer Island consumers are not particularly price-sensitive, especially not in the morning, and would love to have a high-quality alternative to the same-old-same-old.</p> <p>So how about it?&nbsp; Anybody want to go in on an investment in an independent coffee shop?</p>
