<p>I don't have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00666ZTN0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=richasprag-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00666ZTN0">Jawbone UP</a>. I tried to buy one earlier this month but Best Buy wasn't stocking them until the kinks have been worked out. Several of my friends rave about it, though:&#160; it's just a bracelet that you wear and it automatically measures your activity, including your sleep.</p>  <p>The UP is one of a number of devices that try to measure sleep based on your movement in bed. It has a tiny accelerometer that picks up the slightest little twitches of your hand while sleeping. Since sleep phases are often accompanied by such movement,&#160; (the theory is) software can later stitch it together to guess how much time you were in REM sleep or deep sleep. But these twitches are just a proxy for the actual sleep phase,&#160; so I'm skeptical that it can measure it as accurately as the Zeo, which uses special sensors to directly detect the electromagnetic activity in your brain. Still, maybe it's &quot;close enough&quot;, especially if (like me) you don't have any particular sleep issues that need analysis to the nth degree.</p>  <p>Movement detection is pretty easy, and there are plenty of ways to do it.&#160; There's even an App for that! <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smart-alarm-clock-sleep-cycles/id359431485?mt=8">Smart Alarm</a>, by Arawella Corporation, cleverly uses the built-in accelerometer, plus the microphone, to measure your movement at night and guess the amount of various sleep phases.</p>  <p>How does it compare to my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005UJK39Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=richasprag-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005UJK39Y">Zeo Sleep Manager</a>?&#160; Last night I tried both at the same time and here are the results:</p>  <p><a title="View &#39;myZeo Personal Sleep Coach&#39; on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/6534095805"><img style="float: left" title="myZeo Personal Sleep Coach" border="0" alt="myZeo Personal Sleep Coach" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7166/6534095805_14f79775a5.jpg" width="475" height="245" /></a></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><a title="View &#39;Smart Alarm Sleep&#39; on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/6534094851"><img style="float: left" title="Smart Alarm Sleep" border="0" alt="Smart Alarm Sleep" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7012/6534094851_5b8bd50f82.jpg" width="489" height="336" /></a></p>    <p>Answer: Zeo is way better. It’s not even clear that the motion-detection app gave useful information, and might even be outright wrong.</p>  <p>The motion detection method was wrong. It says I:</p>  <ul>   <li>Slept one hour <em>longer </em>than I did. (9 hrs vs 8)</li>    <li>Had more phases of REM sleep (6 vs. 4)</li>    <li>Had less deep sleep (5 vs. 8+)</li> </ul>  <p>Look at the charts and you’ll see the difference.</p>  <p>I don’t know how well this compares to an UP, but I bet the motion-detection systems just aren’t very useful.&#160; If you really want to measure sleep, I say get the Zeo.</p>  <p><iframe style="width: 120px; height: 240px" marginheight="0" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=richasprag-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as4&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;ref=ss_til&amp;asins=B00666ZTN0" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><iframe style="width: 120px; height: 240px" marginheight="0" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=richasprag-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as4&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;ref=ss_til&amp;asins=B002IY65V4" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><iframe style="width: 120px; height: 240px" marginheight="0" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=richasprag-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as4&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;ref=ss_til&amp;asins=B005UJK39Y" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>  <p>By the way, my recommendations:&#160; Zeo comes in two forms: an alarm clock version that doesn’t require anything extra; and a more portable, cheaper version that plugs into your smart phone. If you have an iPhone or an Android, the Mobile Sleep Manager is a little cheaper and smaller.&#160; The Alarm Clock version is nicer if you don’t already have a nice bedside alarm clock, or if you don’t like sleeping near your phone.</p>
