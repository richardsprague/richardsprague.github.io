<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB115950109260277754.html?mod=technology_main_promo_left">MySpace's New Rivals Are Winning Friends - WSJ.com</a><br />Lists <a href="http://www.piczo.com">Piczo </a>(most popular site in Canada), <a href="http://www.xuqa.com">XuQa.com</a>, <a href="http://www.hi5.com">Hi5.com </a>(with a built-in music player), and <a href="http://www.sconex.com">Sconex.com</a> (for high school kids).<br /><br />It's going to be very hard to make any social networking site sticky. By definition, these sites make it easy for you to talk with your friends -- and mobilize them all to another site if you want.<br /><br />A more interesting business, I think, is something truly complementary to Myspace.  What if MySpace were a platform, with an API, and you could build sites that preserve some of your identity at Myspace but allow a richer experience targeted say, to kids who like bugs, or for that matter, moms who like politics.
