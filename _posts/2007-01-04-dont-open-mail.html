<p>As my son grows interested in coin collecting, and my daughter starts on stamps, I wonder how much longer the post office will continue dealing in physical, paper envelopes.</p><p>Here's a start-up in Kirkland that will take your (corporate) mail, scan it, and present it to you in your browser so you don't have to deal with it. They claim 50% of the envelopes they process for customers go unopened.</p><p><a href="http://www.documentcommand.com/index.php" atomicselection="true"><img src="http://www.documentcommand.com/images/dci_logo.gif" /></a> </p><p>They just received $3.5M in Angel funding, which sounds like peanuts for how much they can use when they turn into a serious force.  Can you imagine what they could do internationally?  Imagine if your company could have its postal address in one place and you read all your mail the same day in another?</p>
