<p>We don't get nearly enough sun in the Northwest, but we continue to read and believe advice from the rest of the country about the <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/07/doubts-about-sun-exposure-and-skin.html">dangers of too much sun exposure</a>, even though that advice may not apply to us.</p> <p>Doctors say <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/health/2004179538_vitamind13m.html">most people get too little Vitamin D</a>, and here in Seattle at the <a href="http://www.donaldmiller.com/">University of Washington, Dr. Donald Miller</a> says it may be worse:&nbsp; of the <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/miller/miller25.html">local patients he tested, 78%</a> had low levels, and 10% were "severely deficient".&nbsp; He says deficient levels are correlated with all kinds of nasty things, from cancer to multiple sclerosis. (<a href="http://www.msakc.org/Index.htm">Washington's rate of MS</a> is one of the <a href="http://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/news/20070129/multiple-sclerosis-rates-up-50-percent">highest in the country</a>).</p> <p>Looks like I'm one of the deficient ones too.&nbsp; I had my blood tested and today found out that my Vitamin D level is 16.8 L ng/mL, far below the minimum 32 that many doctors recommend as minimal for good health.&nbsp; </p> <p>Note: for years I've been taking a multivitamin that has 100% of the US RDA for Vitamin D (400 IU), but obviously that hasn't helped.&nbsp; So now I've upped that to 2400 IU/day of Vitamin D3 (the effective kind), and I'll test myself again in a few months to see what happens.</p>
