<p>The New York Times ruined an otherwise fascinating overview of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/magazine/what-do-chinese-dumplings-have-to-do-with-global-warming.html">refrigeration in China</a> by spinning it as an article about climate change ("What Do Chinese Dumplings Have to Do With Global Warming?). Okay, I get how the advent of modern conveniences is increasing China’s use of greenhouse gases, but that’s not what makes it interesting. Here are some interesting facts you may have missed if you file it as just another story about carbon emissions:</p><ul><li>"on average, a Chinese person experiences some kind of digestive upset twice a week”, at least partly due to poor food storage.</li><li>"Nearly half of everything that is grown in China rots before it even reaches the retail market” — refrigerated storage and transportation in this case would greatly help the environment by doubling food production.</li><li>The West has much lower rot-to-market losses, but ultimately we may still throw away just as much food, because we use refrigerators as an excuse to buy more stuff than we can eat — and it ends up rotting at home.</li><li>Refrigeration has many conveniences, but it also drives out the wonderful traditional ways people use for preserving food: salting, fermenting, brining, drying.</li><li>Refrigeration also results in a more homogeneous (and boring) market, because foods can be shipped from farther away without spoiling. Food growers face nationwide competition, driving out many of the local varieties of plants that often form the basis of different regional cuisines.</li></ul><p>I think refrigeration in general is overused (which is why I say<a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2014/08/hold-ice.html"> hold the ice</a>), and I hope China can use the best of refrigeration technology without forgetting the special benefits of traditional food preservation.</p>
