NPR's Margot Adler did an interesting <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4460341">story </a>about  Mel Levine, M.D., director of the University of North Carolina's Clinical Center for the Study of Development and learning, and a co-founder of All Kinds of Minds, an organization that analyzes learning differences.  He talks like my kind of pediatrician.<br /><br />He doesn't look for root causes for learning or developmental problems, saying that's a waste of time because you'll never know for sure what the cause was and you probably can't do anything about it anyway.  Instead, he uses a process he calls "demystification" to work with a child on all their strengths and weaknesses. Once you put a label on a person's weaknesses, he says, it becomes much easier to find solutions.<br /><br />For example, he might take an unruly student and find that they suffer from "sequencing problems", so he'll work with him/her to show how the problem affects them and some things they can do about it. <br /><br /><a href="http://video.google.com/videopreview?q=%22Mel+Levine%22&time=480000&page=1&docid=-1416208670547026639&urlcreated=1106665575&chan=KPIX&prog=60+Minutes&date=Sun+Dec+26+2004+at+7%3A00+PM+PST&hmac=Rdf/0ju1jKbTw8GbdVPhTfiqnro">60 MInutes</a> did a profile of him as well.<br /><br />
