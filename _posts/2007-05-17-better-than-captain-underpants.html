<p>My 7-year-old is just becoming interested in books and of course I want to encourage him, but lately he's been reading the truly awful Captain Underpants series on bathroom-humor.&nbsp; The books are clearly aimed at kids (mostly boys) who otherwise wouldn't bother reading, probably on the theory that reading <em>something</em> is better than nothing. But they're full of deliberate misspellings ("Skool", "teechur") and lurid descriptions of pranks played on incompetent teachers and school officials.&nbsp;Do I really want my kids exposed&nbsp;to what is&nbsp;basically Beevus and Butthead for grade schoolers?</p> <p>But <a href="http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/2007/05/geekdads_love_t.html">Wired's Geek Dad has an alternative suggestion</a>: Japanese manga.&nbsp; How about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159116222X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=gee-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=159116222X" target="_blank">this one</a>, about a prodigy who plays the game of Go:</p> <p><img src="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R342N7QAL._AA240_.jpg"> </p> <p>The books are all cheap (under $10) and, since they're Japanese translations, you get to learn about Japanese culture at the same time.</p> <p>While you're at it, check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Does-Anything-Eat-Wasps-Unsettling/dp/0743297261/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-7542520-6116103?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1179165205&amp;sr=8-1">Does Anything Eat Wasps</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Why-Dont-Penguins-Feet-Freeze/dp/1861978766/ref=sr_1_1/102-7542520-6116103?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1179165173&amp;sr=8-1">Why Don't Penguins Feet Freeze</a>, and other science-oriented titles (also recommended by <a href="http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/">Geekdad</a>).</p>
