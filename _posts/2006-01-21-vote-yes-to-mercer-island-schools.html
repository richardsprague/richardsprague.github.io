Mercer Island has a reputation as a tight community with strong schools. Almost 1/4 of the school budget comes from a property tax allocation called the "general levy" which is up for renewal every couple of years in a special election. <a href="http://www.schoollevyyes.org/">This year's election is on February 7th</a>, and since nothing else is on the ballot it's especially important for people who care about Mercer Island schools to take the effort to turn out.<br /><br />Interestingly, although this one election accounts for a huge part of the school budget, the school district is not allowed to lobby or organize anything in support of the election, so the entire get-out-the-vote effort is run by a bunch of volunteers unaffiliated with the school. Since my wife and I care a lot about Mercer Island school quality, we joined the committee and set up a <a href="http://www.schoollevyyes.com/">web site </a>to promote the cause.<br /><br />Take a look at the site and let me know what you think:<br /><a href="http://www.schoollevyyes.org/">Vote Yes to MI Schools</a> <p><br /><img src="http://ensembio.members.winisp.net/images/schoollevyyeslogo.png" /><br /><p><br /></p>
