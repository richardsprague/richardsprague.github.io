I've seen him give this talk twice already, but if you haven't seen Steven Pinker discuss his most recent book, there's a video version on line at: <a href="http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/23/">MIT World ï¿½ : Play: The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature</a>

<br />Thanks to <a href="http://jasonhamilton.blogspot.com/2005/05/ghost-in-machine.html">Jason Hamilton</a> for the headsup.
