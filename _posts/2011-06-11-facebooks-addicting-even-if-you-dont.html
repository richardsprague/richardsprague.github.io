<p>It’s a few minutes before the next meeting. Or maybe it’s right before dinner is ready. Or there’s a commercial on TV. Or it’s time to go to bed. Or get up.</p>  <p>What’s your first thought at each of these moments? <a href="https://www.facebook.com/#!/richardsprague" target="_blank">Check Facebook</a>! It’s a continuous stream of what’s happening among the people and interests in my life, and it gets more and more useful every day. No wonder more than 100 million Americans log in daily. It’s the most popular web site in the world, and it will keep getting more so.</p>  <p>Many of my friends are silent on Facebook, but I know they’re there, lurking, watching, reading all of my updates. Even the shy ones, or those who think they have nothing themselves to say…they still watch.</p>  <p>Japan’s Mixi social networking service (of which <a href="http://mixi.jp/show_profile.pl?id=186231&amp;from=navi" target="_blank">I am a member</a>, though rarely active) has a great feature that lets you know when somebody has visited your profile. I wish Facebook had something like that. I bet we’d all be surprised – impressed – at the number of our silent friends who actually watch everything we do.</p>
