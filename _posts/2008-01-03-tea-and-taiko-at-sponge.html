<p>Want to expose your kids to a foreign language while they're very young -- the best time for their young brains to soak up the sounds and grammar of Chinese, Spanish, French, Japanese?&nbsp; Bring them to the <a href="http://www.spongeschool.com/">Sponge School</a>, run by my good friend, Jackie Friedman Mighdoll.&nbsp;&nbsp; I first met Jackie more than 10 years ago, in Japan, where she moved after college because she loves languages so much.&nbsp; A few years ago, when she had her first baby, <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2006/03/early-childhood-language-lessons.html">she set up a school</a> to help small children get started with languages.&nbsp; Classes are 55 minutes long, full of games, music, and play designed for 0-4 year olds.&nbsp; </p> <p>Sunday, January 13th is a good time to learn more about Sponge.&nbsp; Jackie's hosting a tea party, featuring a Japanese taiko drum performance by <a href="http://www.yushindaiko.com/index.html">YushinDaiko</a>.&nbsp; It's free, and your toddler will thank you (in some other language, no doubt).</p>Where: 3107 S Day Street, Seattle <br>When: Sunday, January 13th 3-5pm<br>RSVP (not required): <a href="mailto:events@spongeschool.com">events@spongeschool.com</a>  <p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.spongeschool.com/"><img height="134" src="http://www.spongeschool.com/images/sponge_logo_short.gif" width="163"></a></p>
