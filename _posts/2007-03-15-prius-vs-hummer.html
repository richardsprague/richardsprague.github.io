I knew it! Here's proof that the <a href="http://clubs.ccsu.edu/recorder/editorial/editorial_item.asp?NewsID=188">Hummer is better for the environment</a> than a Prius!<br /><br />I told you: I bought mine for the gadgets and because I think it's a nice car. Let the tree-huggers drive around in their big, self-righteous Hummers; I've got <a href="http://priuschat.com/index.php?showtopic=30259&st=0&amp;p=400237&amp;#entry400237">the NRA on my side</a>. And the Prius is better looking!
