<a href="http://www.softpedia.com/">Softpedia</a> is another huge software downloads site I'll check out one of these days.  They appear to have more recent stuff than c|Net Download.com.

<br />They have a bunch of speech-related downloads too, though I could only find TTS apps, and nothing from Microsoft.
