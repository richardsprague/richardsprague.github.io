<p>Today's Pacific Northwest Sunday Magazine in the Seattle Times had us chuckling in the middle of an article on <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/pacificnw09102006/2003248131_pacificploser10.html">why it's so hard to lose weight</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>A TREND IN obesity research is to look beyond individuals and at environments, says Streichert of the exploratory center. <p>The new obesity conversation includes urban planners, architects, grocers, school boards, economists, politicians, transportation experts. <p>&nbsp; <p>What if schools banned high-fat and high-sugar foods? (The Seattle School District did just that in 2004; last year, high-school students said they consumed 20 percent less soda and 13 percent less candy and chips during the school day.) <p>&nbsp; <p>What if sidewalks, bike trails and nearby parks and shops encouraged people to make exercise part of their daily routine?</p> <p><font color="#ff0000">What if we could all afford to eat as if we lived on Mercer Island?</font></p> <p>Obesity rates would plummet, predicts Dr. Adam Drewnowski, who specializes in obesity, economics and taste preference at the UW.</p></blockquote> <p>Mercer Island has its fair share of chubby people, so I'm not sure what this is saying. Maybe it's because we have so few restaurants?</p>
