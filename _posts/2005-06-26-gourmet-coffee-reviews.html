I bought it at Larry's Market, not directly from the roaster, but the taste was pretty good anyway.  The roasteria is at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=1005+East+Pike+Street,+Seattle,+WA+98122&ll=47.614875,-122.319996&spn=0.004538,0.007521&t=k&hl=en">1005 East Pike Street, Seattle, WA 98122</a>, which is only a few blocks south of Espresso Vivace.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/graphics/intellyMain.gif" title="" border="0"><br /><a href="http://www.caffeartigiano.com/">Caffe Artigiano</a> in Vancouver has some of the best coffee I've ever had, so I was surprised to hear they purchase their beans from Intelligentsia in Chicago. Unfortunately for personal quantities that means you either have to live there or buy mail-order and suffer the slightly degraded quality you get when it's not perfectly fresh. But if you ever have the chance to try it, get Luzazatoo Blend, which is excellent for espresso.
