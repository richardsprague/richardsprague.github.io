[<b>Update</b>: uBiome recomputed my results, which are now much closer to what I expected. &nbsp;I'll update with a more detailed post soon.]<br /><br />After all that <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2015/01/how-to-analyze-ubiome-sample-in-excel.html">analysis</a> and <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2015/03/did-raw-potato-starch-wreck-my-gut.html">discussion with experts</a> about my uBiome results, I had high expectations for the brand new set of answers that arrived today.<br /><br />Here’s a comparison chart showing all four of my uBiome submissions:<br /><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-IRix52iAxro/VQM7vixVYpI/AAAAAAAC-8U/FDiJZba215E/s1600-h/Untitled_Clipping_031315_115444_AM%25255B5%25255D.jpg"><img alt="Untitled_Clipping_031315_115444_AM" border="0" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-58f1kXLVj7M/VQM7xSEalXI/AAAAAAAC-8c/1HC7bbbvWo4/Untitled_Clipping_031315_115444_AM_thumb%25255B3%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" height="319" style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="Untitled_Clipping_031315_115444_AM" width="472" /></a><br />In a word: argh!<br /><br />If the January 19th sample had been my first and only uBiome test, I’d be tempted to read a lot into this. After all, it appears that my levels of proteobacteria are way outside the norm. That’s not all: look at some other oddities about this one:<br /><ul><li>That bifido bloom I saw after <a href="http://www.ubiomeblog.com/hacking-sleep/">sleep-hacking with potato starch</a>: it’s all gone. Not a single bifidobacterium was found in this sample. Hmmm.</li><li>Lots of prevotella (almost 3% of the sample), a species that didn’t appear in any of my previous samples, and <a href="http://humanfoodproject.com/from-meat-to-microbes-to-main-street-is-it-time-to-trade-in-your-george-foreman-grill/">a bit worrisome</a> for a meat-eater like me.</li><li>No more Clostridum, either. Commonly thought of as a pathogen, it may be good to get rid of this, but why did it disappear?</li></ul>All of these massive changes in the span of only three months? Not impossible – the human gut can change pretty quickly under the right circumstances. But you’d expect <em>something</em> different about my environment, eating habits, and certainly my health. <br /><br />But here’s the thing: I don’t notice a single difference in my health or well-being over this time period. Same sleep, same weight, same general mood. Diet, bowel movements, skin – like everyone, I see minor day-to-day variations, but absolutely nothing about me is different enough to be noteworthy.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are a few oddities in the sample itself. First, uBiome warned that their first run had too low levels of bacteria; the ones you see above came after they ran the sample again under more amplified settings. Second, I used an older kit, one that had been lying around the house for about a year. Finally, I also ran into trouble <a href="https://twitter.com/sprague/status/565137993740976128">with the mail</a>, so it sat around at the post office for several more weeks than normal. Shouldn’t really matter, but still…<br /><br />Soooo, my bottom line is that I’m just not going to read much into this sample. I’m waiting on my next submission, one that was sent a few weeks after this one, and hopefully <em>that</em> will give me a much better picture.<br /><br />The takeaway for you? Don’t read much into a single uBiome test. The science is too new, and there are so many other factors that go into the results. My advice: send in multiple kits, spread over several weeks or months, before jumping to conclusions.
