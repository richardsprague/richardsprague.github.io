Our garage door wouldn’t open, leaving our car trapped inside. We called <a href="http://www.sounddoorservice.com/">Sound Door Service</a> at 10pm and got an instant quote and appointment for the next morning. “First thing” starts at 8am for them, which is fine.
<br />
<br />Our serviceman, Joel, was super-friendly and helpful. He worked quickly and efficiently, and went out of his way to explain what he was doing so I can do it next time. He really knows doors, suggesting which parts would make it last longer and showing me how to do future maintenance. As a bonus, he even fixed (no charge!) the keyless entry system that we havent been able to get working.
<br />
<br />He charged about $350 to replace the spring, two pulleys, and miscellaneous supplies. The entire process took about 45 minutes
<br />
<br />My only nit was that he arrived 30 min late for the 8:00am appointment, but he called well before that to let us know he was stuck in traffic.
