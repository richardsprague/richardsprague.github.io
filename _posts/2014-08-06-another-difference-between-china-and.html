<p>From Evan Osnos’ new book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374280746/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0374280746&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=richasprag-20&amp;linkId=EA4RWZTY5KT63VIM">Age of Ambition,</a> </em>quoting the work of Yingiang Zhang and Tor Eriksson:</p><blockquote><p>They found that in other developing countries, parents' education was the most decisive factor in determining how much a child would earn someday. But in China, the decisive factor was "parental connections”…Writing in 2010, the authors ranked "urban China among the least socially mobile places in the world."</p></blockquote><p>This is another piece of what I previously referred to as China’s under appreciation for “<a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2011/04/anonymous-exchange.html">anonymous exchange”</a>, the idea that <em>who </em> you know is even more important there than in the West.</p><p>Technology will fix some of this, as people discover the value of online reputation. Of course, your parents’ connections matter, but would they matter as much as getting a whole pile of five-star reviews from strangers?</p><p> </p>
