<p>I've been saying for two years now that <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2011/02/coming-wave-of-sensors.html">hardware is the future of software</a>, and one center of action is the world of Arduino programmable microcontrollers. You can't really learn what's possible in a new technology field without trying it out for yourself, so I took the plunge and tried my own project, a very simple one to measure temperature and humidity in my house. Here's what I did:  <p>I bought the following items (at Amazon)  <ul> <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006H06TVG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006H06TVG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=richasprag-20">Arduino Uno R3</a> $21.95  <li>this temperature/humidity sensor:<br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0066YD3GM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0066YD3GM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=richasprag-20">Virtuabotix DHT11 Digital Temperature/Humidity Sensor</a> $5.60.  <li>and a $22 collection of assorted <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/index.php?title=Arduino_Sidekick_Basic_Kit#Circuit_5">useful parts from Seeedstudio</a> called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007B14HM8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007B14HM8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=richasprag-20">Arduino Sidekick Basic Kit (Version 2</a>) that includes:</li></ul> <p>Breadboard, Jumper wires, Color Led, Resistors, Buzzer, etc., all of this comes in its own handy box for easy transportation and minimal clutter. Parts list: Breadboard X1, Breadboard jumper wire X 70, Red Led X 10, Green Led X 10, RGB led X 1, Ceramic Capacitor (10nF X 10,100nF X 10), Electrolytic Capacitor (100uF X 5), Resistor (330X10,1kX10,10kX10), Tilt switch X 1, Thermistor X 1, Photo resistor X 1, Diode X 1, Buzzer X 1, Push button X 5, switch X 5, Mini Servo X 1, Potentiometer with knob X 1, Resistor Instructor card X 1, Plastic Box X 1  <p>I installed the Arduino development environment on my Win7 PC and then hooked up this simple temperature sensor project: <a title="Arduino DHT11 temperature sensor by sprague, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sprague/8285882619/"><img alt="Arduino DHT11 temperature sensor" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8496/8285882619_f87301df85.jpg" width="375" height="500"></a> </p> <p>The temperature sensor is a DHT11 and Virtuabotix has easy-to-understand<a href="https://www.virtuabotix.com/reference/index.php?title=DHT11_Wiki"> libraries and other installation instructions</a>.  <p>Here's a screen shot of the sensor and development environment in action:  <p><a title="Arduino DHT11 Temperature sensing software by sprague, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sprague/8286946172/"><img alt="Arduino DHT11 Temperature sensing software" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8212/8286946172_5e3f482a11.jpg" width="488" height="500"></a></p> <p>The entire project took about 90 minutes, including unwrapping the Arduino UNO, installing all software and libraries, and configuring and connecting the sensor.  <p>It's extremely exciting to think about (1) how easy it was, and (2) all the other things I'm able to try now that I have this basic level of knowledge.</p>
