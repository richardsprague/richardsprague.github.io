<p>Here are some of the podcasts I've played during the past few days:</p> <p>Radio OpenSource: I heard Steven Pinker host interviews asking various intellectuals about their<a href="http://www.radioopensource.org/edgorg-what-is-your-dangerous-idea/"> most dangerous idea</a>. As always, Pinker is so articulate and describes what I think (e.g. regarding the unlikelihood of intelligent life in outer space). <p>Incidentally, I also found a page dedicated to <a href="http://www.reitstoen.com/pinker.php">Steven Pinker Multimedia</a>: all known audio and video of Steven Pinker. <p>I listened to<a href="http://www.jenniferburns.org/"> Jennifer Burns</a>, a professor from UC-Berkeley. Her lectures on US History are available on iTunes, including the one I listened to called "Rise of the Religious Right". <p>Harvard professor <a href="http://www.radioopensource.org/niall-fergusons-war-of-the-world/">Niall Ferguson discusses his new book</a> War of the Worlds on Open Source.&nbsp; He's a historian who claims big wars result from the three E's: economic volatility, empire descent, and ethnic tension.&nbsp; All three are in place now in Iraq and portend a big WWII-style conflict.&nbsp; I originally heard about this book in an NPR interview, so it was nice to get a longer version of it.&nbsp; (Incidentally, the Economist <a href="http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_GJJJVJS">thinks it's an okay book</a> by a brilliant, if too populist, historian). <p>Plus, I listened to several short news podcasts by The Economist, Wall Street Journal, and Scientific American.
