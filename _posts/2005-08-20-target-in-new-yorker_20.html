Slate summarizes the <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2124604/">history of Target</a>, which bought every ad in this week's New Yorker.<br /><p><br /><img src="http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/16//nav/logo_target_bullseye.gif"><br /><p><br />Some quotes:<blockquote>The now-famous "Tar-zhay" pun, emphasizing Target's exalted place in the discount world, dates back to the store's founding in 1962. <br /><p><br />As Target prepared to open its first store in metro New York in 1997, its image became synonymous with inexpensive indulgence. In a Christmas photo op, Michael Bloomberg was seen exiting a local Target clutching a George Foreman grill and a cheese grater, gifts that would surely please one of the gardeners at Gracie Mansion.<br /><p><br />The rich (at least in Manhattan) profess to visit Target because of its social progressivism. Target, they insist, is a more enlightened corporate behemoth. Viewed through the Upper West Side prism in which "enlightened" equals "liberal," there is some truth to this contention. Sam Walton's heirs donate to the GOP, while Target scion Mark Dayton serves as a Democrat in the U.S. Senate.<br /><p><br />The Brooklyn Target has an in-store Starbucks.</blockquote>
