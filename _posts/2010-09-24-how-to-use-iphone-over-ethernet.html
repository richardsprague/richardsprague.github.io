<p>Okay, you're not really doing iPhone directly over Ethernet, and you'll need a Mac close by to do it, but this is a trick I find handy in hotels that offer wired ethernet for free, but where they charge for WiFi (like <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/shacp-shanghai-marriott-hotel-changfeng-park/">Marriott Changfeng Park</a> in Shanghai).</p><p>Set up your Mac (I use a MacBook Pro) to do internet sharing over Airport, and you can become your own WiFi hotspot, easily connected to from your iPhone or iPad.</p><p>Under System Preferences (available under the apple menu), under "Internet and Wireless", select Sharing, and do this:</p><p><a title="View 'Internet Sharing (Mac)' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/5021640820"><img title="Internet Sharing (Mac)" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4128/5021640820_ba2316e43f.jpg" border="0" alt="Internet Sharing (Mac)" width="500" height="371" /></a></p><p>Note: I have file sharing turned on as well, but that's not necessary (and normally it's a good idea to keep it turned off).</p><p>Also, remember that you'll have to uncheck the Internet Sharing box before you can select different ways of sharing your connection.  You'll want to select "AirPort" to create the WiFi hotspot.</p><p> </p>
