<p>Neal pointed me <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21840954/">Bridge Tracker,</a> a site that uses Virtual Earth to let you know the level of safety (or danger) for public bridges near you. Here's what it says I face when traveling to <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2006/07/espresso-vivace-in-seattle-times.html">Espresso Vivace</a> (where I must go this weekend to pick up some fresh beans): </p> <p><a title="Bridge from Mercer Island to Espresso Vivace Seattle" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2235990295/"><img alt="Bridge from Mercer Island to Espresso Vivace Seattle" src="http://static.flickr.com/2391/2235990295_b4561d27bb.jpg" border="0"></a></p> <p>The blue markers on the map indicate bridges which have passed inspection recently. Looks like I'll be okay. Whew!</p>
