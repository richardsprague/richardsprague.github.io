<p><a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/01/mercer-island-farmers-market.html">It's finally here!</a>&nbsp; I was out of town during last week's opening day, but the first thing I did upon arriving back was to head over to Mercerdale park (across from the post office) to check out the new Mercer Island Farmers Market.&nbsp; The Mercer Island blog, Surrounded By Water, <a href="http://mercerislandblogger.wordpress.com/tag/farmers-market/">wrote a nice description</a> of it last weekend, so I was already prepared to be impressed but it was even better than I'd hoped.</p> <p>Main thing I liked?&nbsp; Variety.&nbsp; The organizers focused on variety in vendors, not just quantity, so you can find a little bit of everything, from&nbsp; <a href="http://www.rivervalleycheese.com/">River Valley Cheese</a> to soup to Humingbird Hill sodas to <a href="http://www.purepassiondesserts.com/">Pure Passion Desserts</a> to Wild Alaska salmon from <a href="http://www.twoifbyseafoods.net/">Two If By Seafood</a>.&nbsp; Even the produce wasn't just the same-old-same-old:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.kittitasvalleygreenhouse.com/">Kittitas Valley Greenhouse</a> must have been selling a dozen different varieties of tomatoes (I bought the Amish ones: very very tasty!)</p> <p>By the way, it's the taste and variety that make the prices reasonable to me. Sure, you can buy cardboard-tasting, pesticide-soaked vegetables on sale at the supermarket for much less money, and there is a dollar menu at <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2005/07/debunking-super-size-me_08.html">the fine McDonalds</a> just down the street.&nbsp; But <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/08/book-fast-food-nation.html">this is America</a> and you <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/05/in-defense-of-food-book.html">deserve to eat well</a>, not just cheap.</p> <p>Of course the other nice thing is just getting out into the community and bumping into friends.&nbsp; I was too busy talking and didn't film as much as I'd hoped, but here's a 2-minute video of what I saw: </p><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/feqpr6nF6vE" width="425" height="350" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"> </embed>
