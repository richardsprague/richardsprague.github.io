The Mercer Island School District levy <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/elections/2006feb/resPage2.htm">passed by a comfortable margin</a>: more than 70%. <br /><br />Homeowners like me are <a href="http://www.schoollevyyes.org/">very supportive</a> because we know that good schools translates into higher property values and ever-rising living standards.<br /><br />About 5,000 people voted, out of a total voting population of 15,000.  That's half as many who voted in <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/elections/2005Nov/resPage16.htm">last November's </a>election. About 1,300 people on the Island can be officially classified as nay-sayers.
