<p>Ted sent me <a href="http://www.fll.vt.edu/French/whyfrench.html">a whole bunch of reasons</a> why I should have studied French.&nbsp; </p> <p>Did you know:</p> <ul> <li>France has the sixth largest economy in the world after the U.S., Japan, Germany, China and England.&nbsp; [of course a few years ago they were the 4th largest, but hey]</li> <li>France is the world's third military power (after the US and Russia), and has the world's second largest defense industry (i.e. exocet missiles, radar technology.)</li> <li>France is the fourth largest producer of automobiles in the world (Renault, Peugeot, CitroÃ«n) and the third largest exporter.</li> <li>France is fourth in research among countries of the Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation (after Japan, Germany, and the US).</li></ul> <p>Here's the best quote of the article:</p> <blockquote> <p>When deciding on a foreign language for work or school, consider that French is the language that will give you <strong>the most choices later</strong> on in your studies or your career.</p></blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="http://www.fll.vt.edu/French/icons/small.GIF"></p>
