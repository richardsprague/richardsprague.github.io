<p><img src="https://www.stolenidsearch.com/res/logo_sis.gif"> </p> <p>Answer: no.</p> <p>Plug your social security number or credit card number into <a href="https://www.stolenidsearch.com/">this specialized search engine</a> and it will look through the universe of stolen numbers to tell whether your number has been compromised.&nbsp; I tried it and it turned up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupkis">bubkis</a>.&nbsp; For $8/year, they'll continue to monitor a list of your numbers and email you if something fishy ever happens.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>So how do I know this website doesn't just harvest everything you type and then use it against you?&nbsp; First, <a href="https://www.trustedid.com/html/identity_theft_protection_faqs.php">they promise</a> they don't.&nbsp; Second, they are backed by <a href="http://www.dfj.com/">Draper Fisher Jurvetson</a>, a leading Silicon Valley venture capital firm.</p>
