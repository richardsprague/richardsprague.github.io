<p>I'm at the Consumer Electronics Show this week, enjoying all the latest cool gadgets, including this one:</p> <p><a title="World's largest TV (150&quot;)" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2176552677/"><img alt="World's largest TV (150&quot;)" src="http://static.flickr.com/2313/2176552677_b558c2bc7a.jpg" border="0"></a></p> <p>Okay, it's just a prototype for now, but how long till they make this available for normal people?</p> <p>Here's another cool TV, from Sony.&nbsp; It's made from OLED technology, which is not only very bright (i.e. easy to view) but it's also very, very thin.</p> <p><a title="Sony OLED 21&quot; TV" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2177360344/"><a title="ultra-thin OLED Sony display" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2177366196/"><img height="256" alt="ultra-thin OLED Sony display" src="http://static.flickr.com/2372/2177366196_c4343d862b.jpg" width="150" border="0"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img style="margin: 5px 0px 0px 25px" height="264" alt="Sony OLED 21&quot; TV" src="http://static.flickr.com/2417/2177360344_1baa882a61.jpg" width="240" border="0"></a></p> <p>Study the photo on the left carefully.&nbsp; It's a side shot of the 21" TV set on the right.&nbsp; It's so incredibly thin you'll have to be careful not to cut yourself if you hold it.</p> <p> (See more of my CES experiences on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sprague/">my work blog)</a></p>
