Washington, California, and other Western States just came under a new law that requires credit companies to give us free reports once a year.  I checked <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/credit/ycr_free_reports.htm">The FTC's website on Credit</a> to see how this works and I got my credit report quickly.

<br />I'm completely in the clean, which is nice to know.  Other states come on line over the next few months.
