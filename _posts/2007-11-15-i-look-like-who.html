<p><a href="http://www.myheritage.com/FP/Company/tryFaceRecognition.php?collage=1">Here's a site</a> that lets you upload a photo of yourself, which it then compares mathematically to a bunch of celebrities in order to guess who most resembles you.&nbsp; Here's what it thinks about me:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a title="MyHeritage - free family trees, genealogy and face recognition" href="http://www.myheritage.com/collage" target="_blank" alt="MyHeritage - free family trees, genealogy and face recognition"><img height="574" src="http://www.myheritagefiles.com/I/storage/site1/files/45/81/82/458182_850165b47cc374pezgd247.JPG" width="450" border="0"></a> </p> <p>I have no idea who half these "celebrities" are.&nbsp; Try it on your own photo.&nbsp; The site lets you upload any photo for free without registration, so there's no need to fiddle with passwords or risk getting yourself spammed.&nbsp; It's pretty quick too.</p> <p>Another (free) service will tell you which parent (mom or dad) your child most resembles.&nbsp; I'm going to upload a photo of our mailman just to double-check.</p>
