<p>I think there are at least two kinds of politicians: the &quot;populists&quot; and the &quot;wonks&quot;. Too many politicians are populists, who treat government like a popularity contest: a grown-up version of the Homecoming King and Queen (come to think of it, a lot of politicians <em>are</em> former homecoming kings).</p>  <p>We need more wonks, which is why I'm voting for<a href="http://vote4fred.org/default.aspx"> Fred Jarrett</a>. Meet him in person like I did this weekend and you'll see why: he is knee-deep in the details about the issues that matter to him (and me): like <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/search/label/Education" target="_blank">education</a>&#160; and <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/01/my-new-car.html" target="_blank">transportation</a>.</p>  <p>Here are a couple of areas where he changed my mind:</p>  <ul>   <li>Vote no on <a href="http://permanent-offense.org/">I-985</a>: I'm partial to cars--<a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/06/mass-transit-vs-green-alternatives.html">it's far and away the most important way</a> people get around, and I disagree with the do-goodies who push ultra-expensive mass transit that won't help a bit. I figured there's enough opposition to I-985 that it won't pass anyway, but I want to send a message that cars are important. Not anymore. Fred thinks it's likely to pass, unfortunately. I agree with him that it would be a disaster (micromanage how traffic lights get synchronized? Puh-lease)</li>    <li>It’s possible to get bad teachers to quit, through policy changes that don’t have to upset their union.&#160; Best example: make pensions portable.&#160; A lot of middle-aged teachers would love to change jobs but the golden handcuffs of their generous pensions are keeping them there.&#160; What if we could make their pensions portable?&#160; through defined contribution (like the 401k that I have) or through something else…&#160; I think that’s the <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/12/how-to-improve-schools.html">single best way</a> to improve schools.</li>    <li>Tolling on I-90.&#160; Fred’s opponent, Bob Baker, talks like it’s a simple matter of “just say no”, but in fact Bob Baker’s naive stance would make matters far worse for Mercer Island.&#160; [this deserves its own post, like the one from <a href="http://mercerislandblogger.wordpress.com/2008/10/06/toll-us-its-better-than-the-alternative/" target="_blank">Surrounded by Water</a>]</li> </ul>  <p>I'm not surprised the non-partisan Municipal League <a href="http://www.munileague.org/candidate-evaluations/previous-ratings/2008/2008-candidate-questionnaires/jarrett.pdf">gives Fred the highest rating</a> for our district.</p>  <p>Stop by the <a href="http://whatittakesforkids.com/">Education Funding blog</a> he runs with several other legislators for more wonky details.</p>  <p><a title="Vote for Fred Jarret, Washington 41st Legislative District" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2977555723/"><img alt="Vote for Fred Jarret, Washington 41st Legislative District" src="http://static.flickr.com/3241/2977555723_f880b1f286.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>
