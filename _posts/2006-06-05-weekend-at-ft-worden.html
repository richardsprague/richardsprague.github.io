My son and I are part of the Mercer Island Y-Guides program, in a nice group of boys from West Mercer called the "Screaming Wolves". We spent last weekend at Fort Worden, not far from Port Townsend on the Olympic Penninsula.<br /><br />Watch the video:<br /><br /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ddrOszgK1qU" width="600" height="350" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed><br /><br />Fathers of boys and girls from kindergarten through third grade are encouraged to join the Y-guides, and for some reason Mercer Island has one of the highest participation rates in the country (I'm told that the girls' group has <em>the</em> highest).  Back in Neillsville when I was a boy, we had cub scouts, but I don't see much scouting activity here.  Hopefully that changes with older kids.
