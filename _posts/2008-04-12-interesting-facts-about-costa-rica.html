<p>We're back from our trip -- a very busy, jam-packed, hectic vacation in Costa Rica.&nbsp; This was my first time to visit the country, and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sprague/archive/2005/09/17/470063.aspx">as I always say when arriving in a new place</a>, visiting in person is the best way to pick up interesting facts, so here are some of the tidbits I discovered:</p> <ul> <li>Biggest <a href="http://www.intel.com/community/costarica/index.htm">employer is Intel</a>, which makes nearly all of its server chips there. <li>Has never had a military, and is proud of its strong constitution and stable democracy. <li>23% of the country is protected forests and reserves <li>They don't trill their r's, like other Spanish speakers <li>Home to <a href="http://pages.interlog.com/~rainfrst/wildlife.html">more unique species</a> of birds (over 850) and insects (over 35,000) than the rest of North America or Europe. More than 10% of the world's butterflies live here.</li></ul> <p>I had expected it to be poor and run-down like other developing countries, but I was pleasantly surprised. For a tourist, even traveling in the countryside, I found it not much different than Hawaii, only cheaper.&nbsp; Everyone takes US dollars and is friendly to Americans, and you won't have trouble speaking English anywhere.&nbsp; Plus, it's only a 3 1/2 hour flight from Dallas, and you're on basically the same time zone when you arrive--no jet lag!</p> <p>I felt safe and clean the whole time, no nasty mosquitoes or other annoyances.&nbsp; Definitely recommended, even if you are traveling like we were with small children.</p> <p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:84E294D0-71C9-4bd0-A0FE-95764E0368D9:6b1442cd-41ca-4867-b910-4737cc243779" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"><a href="http://maps.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&amp;cp=9.860628~-83.78174&amp;lvl=6&amp;style=r&amp;mkt=en-US&amp;FORM=LLWR" id="map-3b8609e7-109c-4c5c-9047-492e1b746f21" alt="Click to view this map on Live.com" title="Click to view this map on Live.com"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/richardsprague/SADCehlWPkI/AAAAAAAAAps/wAFslvGu_NI/map-1d6d9a1a617d.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="Map image"></a></div></p>
