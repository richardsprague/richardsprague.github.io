Here's an app written by a guy whose cell phone is hooked up to a Mappoint Location Server: <a href="http://www.whatididwaswrong.com/whereissteve/">Where is Steve?</a>
<br />
<br />It tells you where he is, using cell locating technology built into lots of phones these days.  I can't wait till all cell phones support this.
