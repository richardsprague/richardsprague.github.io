<p><img src="http://www.farecast.com/images/site_header.jpg"> </p> <p>Next time you buy a plane ticket, use <a href="http://www.farecast.com/">Farecast</a>, a Seattle-based company that has reverse-engineered the algorithms used by the airlines to compute plane ticket prices. Is it better to buy today or wait until next week?&nbsp; Farecast tells you the answer.&nbsp; <a href="http://richardsprague.blogspot.com/2006_07_01_richardsprague_archive.html">I've been blogging</a> about these guys since they were beta, but they've come a long way since then.</p> <p>For example, they now have a way to lock in a fare without buying the ticket.&nbsp; If you pay them $10 (or $3 during their current special deal), they will guarantee for one week whatever lowest price you find today.</p> <p>For example, suppose I want to fly my parents here to Seattle to visit me sometime in the next several months.&nbsp; According to Farecast, the lowest price is $257 if they leave on the afternoon of Feb 6th or 7th.&nbsp; The next lowest price is $309.&nbsp; Imagine if I had tried to find this fare the old-fashioned way, plugging in various dates one after another.&nbsp; </p> <p>Another way to search is by destination.&nbsp;Where are all the cities I can fly to for less than $200 on my birthday?&nbsp; Who would have guessed that I can go to New Orleans?&nbsp; Or Philadelphia?&nbsp; Plenty of restrictions apply (I have to leave Tuesday and return Saturday), but hey, a deal is a deal!</p>
