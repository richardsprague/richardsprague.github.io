<a href="http://www.kuow.org/DefaultProgram.asp?ID=10329">94.9 KUOW</a> broadcast a segment about the <a href="http://www.spongeschool.com/">Sponge School</a>, run by my friend <a href="http://www.spongeschool.com/">Jackie Friedman</a>. It's a local language school that gives exposure to the sounds and fun of other languages to very young kids. They already have 120 families signed up for their 19-session programs. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.spongeschool.com/images/sponge_logo_short.gif" />
