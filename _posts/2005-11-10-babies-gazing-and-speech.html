Watch for the point when a developing baby starts following your gaze.  
<br /><a href="http://uwnews.org/uweekarticle.asp?articleID=13431">uwnews.org | University of Washington News and Information</a>: "UW psychologists Rechele Brooks and Andrew Meltzoff have pinpointed this developmental step as beginning somewhere in the 10th or 11th month of life, and have found that infants who are advanced in gaze-following behavior before their first birthday understand nearly twice as many words when they are 18 months old.
