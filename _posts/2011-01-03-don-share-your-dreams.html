<p>In this <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_keep_your_goals_to_yourself.html">new TED Talk</a>, Derek Sivers (the guy who made that viral video on <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_how_to_start_a_movement.html">how to start a movement</a>) gives reasons to walk the walk, rather than talk.</p><!--copy and paste--><p><object width="446" height="326"><param name="movie" value="http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="bgColor" value="#ffffff" /><param name="flashvars" value="vu=http://video.ted.com/talks/dynamic/DerekSivers_2010G-medium.flv&amp;su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/DerekSivers-2010G.embed_thumbnail.jpg&amp;vw=432&amp;vh=240&amp;ap=0&amp;ti=947&amp;introDuration=15330&amp;adDuration=4000&amp;postAdDuration=830&amp;adKeys=talk=derek_sivers_keep_your_goals_to_yourself;year=2010;theme=new_on_ted_com;theme=unconventional_explanations;theme=how_the_mind_works;theme=a_taste_of_tedglobal_2010;theme=how_we_learn;theme=the_creative_spark;event=TEDGlobal+2010;&amp;preAdTag=tconf.ted/embed;tile=1;sz=512x288;" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="446" height="326" src="http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf" pluginspace="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" wmode="transparent" bgcolor="#ffffff" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" flashvars="vu=http://video.ted.com/talks/dynamic/DerekSivers_2010G-medium.flv&amp;su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/DerekSivers-2010G.embed_thumbnail.jpg&amp;vw=432&amp;vh=240&amp;ap=0&amp;ti=947&amp;introDuration=15330&amp;adDuration=4000&amp;postAdDuration=830&amp;adKeys=talk=derek_sivers_keep_your_goals_to_yourself;year=2010;theme=new_on_ted_com;theme=unconventional_explanations;theme=how_the_mind_works;theme=a_taste_of_tedglobal_2010;theme=how_we_learn;theme=the_creative_spark;event=TEDGlobal+2010;"></embed></object></p><p>He's right. We all know people who are forever making some new affirmation about themselves.  But notice that physically fit people talk about fitness <em>after</em> they're healthy, real authors talk about books <em>after</em> they're written, engaged people talk about marriage after they've set the date.  You know who you are.</p><p>One of the many things I respect about the New Apple (the one after Steve came back, as opposed to the one where I once worked) is how they talk about new products <em>after </em>they're finished and ready to sell. Too many people and companies, in the name of "setting expectations" or "being predictable", give their customers a "roadmap" for the future.  I think the only roadmap that counts is your track record.</p>
