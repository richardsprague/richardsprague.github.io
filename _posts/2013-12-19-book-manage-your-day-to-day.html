The bottom line: focus.</p> <p>Here are some of the specific tips worth remembering:</p> <ul> <li>Do your most creative work first thing in the day, before everything else.</li> <li>“Feel the frequency”: set up a routine, doing the same things at the same time.</li> <li>Defend your creative time against all interruptions: schedule it on the calendar and treat it seriously.</li> <li>It’s harder to see day-to-day progress on long, big (and hence worthwhile) projects, so invent metrics to enable self-tracking.</li></ul> <p>Two specific ways to break mental blocks:</p> <ul> <li>[Ray Bradbury]: make a list of random word pairs, then force yourself to piece together a story about them.</li> <li>[Edward de Bono] Repetition is the enemy of insight. Take a starting point that has nothing to do with your project and work from there.</li></ul> <p>Most of these tips are found elsewhere, so I didn’t think this was a breakthrough book, but it’s a readable and inspiring.</p>
