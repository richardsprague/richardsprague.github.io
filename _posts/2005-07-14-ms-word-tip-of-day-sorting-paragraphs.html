<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB112130140882385310,00.html?mod=djemTECH">WSJ.com - Mossberg's Mailbox</a> has a great tip I'll have to remember.
<br />
<br />Let's say you've got a bunch of entries for a bibliography or another list that you want sorted. For example, maybe it's list of people you're tracking for a party invitation or mail merge.
<br />
<br />Just enter all your information in separate paragraphs like you do normally.  Then select Table / Sort and Word will sort it by paragraph.  Easy!
