<p>Be still my beating heart!&nbsp; HD video cameras are here at affordable prices.&nbsp; <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/Sony_Handycam_HDR_SR1/4505-6500_7-31979960.html?tag=nl.e496">CNet</a> and CamcorderInfo review the new $1400 Sony HDR-SR1, as the "<a href="http://www.camcorderinfo.com/content/Sony-HDR-SR1-Camcorder-Review.htm">most forward-facing camcorder of the year</a>".</p> <p><img src="http://www.sonystyle.com/intershoproot/eCS/Store/en/imagesProducts/180x180/HDRSR1.jpg"> </p> <p>When I looked into this one year ago, I concluded that <a href="http://richardsprague.blogspot.com/2006/01/hd-camcorders.html">HD camcorders aren't worth buying</a>, but that's no longer true.&nbsp; Some of the features I like:</p> <ul> <li>can output to standard def TV sets.&nbsp; You basically don't need to worry about getting the video out because it will convert to SD when necessary.</li> <li>30GB hard drive lets you leave tape behind and stores up to 4hrs of video with random access in VCR mode.</li></ul> <p>What I don't like</p> <ul> <li>uses compressed AVCHD format instead of the lossless format you get on miniDV.</li> <li>requires proprietary Sony software to get the video into your computer.&nbsp; This is a big deal if you need to run the camera on some OS not supported by Sony (like something in the future)</li></ul> <p>I won't replace my Panasonic GS-400 yet, but it's clear that by next year at this time my tape-based SD camera will look&nbsp;pretty ancient.</p>
