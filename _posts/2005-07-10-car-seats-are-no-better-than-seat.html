From a <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/LevittAcademicPaper.pdf">brand new paper </a>by the author of Freakonomics:
<br />
<br />"Using data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) on all fatal
<br />crashes in the United States from 1975-2003, I find that child safety seats, in actual
<br />practice, are no better than seat belts at reducing fatalities among children aged 2-6."
