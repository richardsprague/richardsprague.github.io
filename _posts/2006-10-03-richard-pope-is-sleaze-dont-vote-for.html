<p>Until I started to understand the importance of local politics, I never took local elections all that seriously. What difference does it make who wins the race for district judge?&nbsp; The "will of the people" will ensure that in the long run the right person will win.</p> <p>But some people really are crooks and sleazes.&nbsp; Take this guy for example:&nbsp; Bellevue "lawyer" Richard Pope:</p> <p><img src="http://www.campaignsitebuilder.com/user/RPope98155aolcom/gal/richard_pope2.jpg"> </p> <p>He's rated "Not Qualified" by the King County Bar Association, having been <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/286178_courtvoted.html">cited for "unprofessional conduct"</a> as a lawyer in four cases.</p> <p>The bad news is that he actually won the primary!&nbsp; I guarantee that <a href="http://www.popeforjudge.com/">anybody who looks at his record</a> or the things said about him would never vote for him.&nbsp; So who did?</p> <p>Maybe people thought he had a nicer name than the other candidates.&nbsp; Maybe they vaguely remember seeing one of his signs out on Island Crest Way.&nbsp; Maybe his name rings a bell because he's run ten times in the past, so after a while you just start thinking he's already somebody important.</p> <p>Fortunately, several legitimate organizations have come together on a non-partisan basis to post objective facts about each of the candidates on <a href="http://www.votingforjudges.org">http://www.votingforjudges.org</a>.&nbsp; I am definitely going to look at that before the next election.</p>
