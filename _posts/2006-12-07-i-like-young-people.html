I just took the Harvard <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/Study?tid=-1">Implicit Association Test</a>, which concluded that I have a strong automatic preference for young compared to old.  That's not unusual -- about 35% of the people who took the same test had the same result. <br /><br />The same site has tests for attitudes about race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc.  If I take those tests I probably won't bother tell you the results.<br /><br />One thing I wish the site did: tell me how I compare with other people from the same demographic. The site collects my zip code, occupation, education level, etc.  -- I wish they would expose the results they get.
