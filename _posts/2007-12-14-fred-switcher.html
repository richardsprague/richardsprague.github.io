<p>Several people have asked me what I think about the decision by our state representative, Fred Jarrett to <a href="http://www.vote4fred.com/">switch to the Democratic Party</a>.&nbsp; The problem is, I have nothing <a href="http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/davidpostman/archives/2007/12/jarrett_quits_gop_will_run_for_senate_as_a_democrat_1.html">original</a> to say.&nbsp; Most of us really like Fred and think he's a reasonable and responsible guy, so I assume his decision to switch sides was neither a betrayal of all that is good, nor a <a href="http://www.horsesass.org/?p=3963">vindication of the cause of truth</a>.&nbsp; As a moderate Republican, he had the advantage of being the swing (and thus influential) vote on controversial issues, something he'll lose by being "just another Democrat" in a homogenous legislature.&nbsp; He's a smart guy, so I guess he just figured that all-in-all he's better off with earlier access to the closed-door inter-party discussions than he did by being the first guy that all sides rush to when they want something approved.</p> <p>Is there more to say?&nbsp; Let me know in the comments.</p> <p>But what I really think is that this shows another reason I wish Mercer Island had its own online network of blogs where we have discussions like this in public.&nbsp; I shouldn't be the only person on the Island who posts publicly about local issues.&nbsp; Many of you are emailing your friends with your opinions, or posting to private Listservs and closed discussion groups.&nbsp; What a waste!&nbsp; Say what you think in a way that will make your thoughts discoverable by other people who can join you. </p> <p>Incidentally, I'm holding a series of brainstorming sessions next week with people who have contacted me about starting a Mercer Island online network.&nbsp; Let me know if you're interested in joining.</p>
