<p>After reading <a href="http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10150312">the writeup in this week's Economist</a>, I just had to try coffee made on one of those high powered <a href="http://cloverequipment.com/home/Default.aspx">Clover machines</a>. Made by a small company in the Fremont area of Seattle,&nbsp;the $11,000 devices supposedly extract a whole new level of&nbsp;flavor from the beans.&nbsp; Naturally I wanted to try for myself and&nbsp;discovered there is&nbsp;one installed at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.trabantcoffee.com/">Trabant, in Pioneer Square</a>&nbsp;so I rushed <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;time=&amp;date=&amp;ttype=&amp;q=602+2nd+ave,+seattle&amp;sll=47.564132,-122.226934&amp;sspn=0.009035,0.020492&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=1">over there</a> this afternoon.</p> <p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2054/2041972346_66fa9c1772.jpg?v=0"> </p> <p>Unfortunately I missed today's coffee tasting, but the barista was super-helpful&nbsp;and&nbsp;patiently explained the entire Clover equipment process to me.&nbsp; You can think of the machines as essentially a reverse french press: instead of pouring water on top of the ground beans, a vacuum sucks water <em>through</em> them, at carefully controlled temperature and pressure.&nbsp; See that round disc under the water spigot in this picture?&nbsp; Just drop the ground beans there and in less than a minute it brews the perfect cup.&nbsp; </p> <p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2325/2041174723_c1af1ce79e.jpg?v=0"> </p> <p>&nbsp;So what about the taste?&nbsp; I tried the <a href="http://www.cupofexcellence.org/CountryPrograms/ElSalvador/2006Program/AuctionResults/tabid/278/ctl/FarmDetails/mid/708/ItemID/554/Default.aspx">El Salvador Mercedes</a>&nbsp;and it was excellent.&nbsp; It's such a unique flavor, it almost doesn't taste like regular coffee.&nbsp;It's hard to describe, but it tastes more fruity, almost like an herbal tea.&nbsp; Later she gave me a sip of some of their $54/pound coffee (I think it was the <a href="http://www.cupofexcellence.org/CountryPrograms/Guatemala/2006Program/AuctionResults/tabid/280/ctl/FarmDetails/mid/712/ItemID/562/Default.aspx">El Injerto</a>).&nbsp; It was phenomenal!&nbsp; I will definitely be back.</p>
