<p>A recent survey by Baylor University (<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20060912/1a_cover12.art.htm">summarized in today's USAToday</a>) found that:</p> <ul> <li>28.5% of Americans have read <em>The Davinci Code</em>.</li> <li>44% have seen <em>The Passion of the Christ</em>.</li> <li>19% have read at least one of the <em>Left Behind</em> novels.</li> <li>25% of US women have read <em>The Purpose-Driven Life</em>.</li></ul> <p>The study authors also decided that&nbsp;the respondents (a statistically-valid representative sample of all Americans) divided their attitudes toward God into these categories:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Authoritarian (28%):</strong> God is angry at sinners and won't hesitate to throw disaster at the unfaithful.</li> <li><strong>Benevolent (23%):</strong> God sets absolute standards but is inclined to be nice to us.</li> <li><strong>Distant (24.4%):</strong> God is a cosmic force that launched the world and now lets it run on its own.&nbsp; [This is the God most common among Catholics and Jews]</li> <li><strong>Critical (16%):</strong> God is judgmental, but isn't going to intervene one way or the other.</li></ul> <p>[source: Baylor University's Institute for Studies of Religion, funded by the John Templeton Foundation]</p>
