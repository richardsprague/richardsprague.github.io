The New York Times Magazine (Sep 10) has a gushing review of <a href="http://beta.sf.flavorpill.net/43919">Flavorpill </a>, a new site for cultural events that is gaining a wide audience for its nice whats-new coverage.  You get an email each Tuesday that describes all the music, lectures, and other events happening for the next week, all very web2.0 with forwarding to your cell phone, etc.<br /><br />It's available now for NYC, San Francisco, Chicago, London, and (soon) Miami.  I'm sure they're also working on a Seattle version.
