<p>Look who was recently honored with <a href="http://www.misd.k12.wa.us/schools/wm/pta_info.html">this year's PTA</a> Outstanding Advocate Award:</p> <p><a title="scan0002" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2544522821/"><img alt="scan0002" src="http://static.flickr.com/3009/2544522821_edd0ca7c0a.jpg" border="0"></a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> Quite an achievement, but believe me, you don't know the half of what she advocates.</p>
