<p>I told you <a href="http://richardsprague.blogspot.com/2005_08_01_richardsprague_archive.html">what I think</a> of the Peak Oil movement (it's hogwash, based partly on <a href="http://richardsprague.blogspot.com/2005/04/partys-over-book-review.html">simple math errors),</a> so I raised my eyebrows a bit at the Seattle Times article profiling the group <a href="http://www.seattleoil.com/">Seattle Peak Oil</a>.</p> <p>I don't know which way the price of oil will go long term -- though I presume it will go up -- but the amount of energy being put into <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.12/energy.html">finding alternatives</a> is the classic way the Invisible Hand successfully solves problems like that.</p> <p>These people remind me of the survivalists, who got some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivalist#1980s">attention back in the 1980s</a> when people were afraid that Ronald Reagan was going to bring us nuclear war.&nbsp; It's not that their predictions are wrong (after all, they're right that the world <em>will</em> end some day).&nbsp; But <em>timing</em> is everything.&nbsp; </p> <p>(more interesting discussion on <a href="http://soundpolitics.com/archives/007786.html">Sound Politics</a>)</p>
