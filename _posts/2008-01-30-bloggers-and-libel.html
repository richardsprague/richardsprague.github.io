<p>It's fun, though a bit annoying, to watch inept PR firms try to shut down free speech in the name of "libel".&nbsp; One of my favorite foodie blogs, <a href="http://whattoeatbook.com/">What To Eat</a>, just <a href="http://whattoeatbook.com/2008/01/29/ah-the-center-for-consumer-freedom/">received such a threat</a> from one David Martosko, claiming to represent the Center for Consumer Freedom, which the blog has been criticizing. </p> <p>I hope his silly threat, and all similar ones directed toward people who exercise their First Amendment rights, ends up in a big backfire, providing even more publicity to the words we all enjoy.&nbsp; Watch over the next few days as the Google search results shift against David Martosko and the Center shift as more people hear and write about their dumb action.</p> <p>Incidentally, I don't even care that much about the facts of the case.&nbsp; This is the internet. If you disagree with what somebody writes, get your own blog and tell us about it.&nbsp; Don't go threatening a stupid and irrelevant lawsuit.</p>
