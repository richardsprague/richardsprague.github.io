<p>Minimalism is wonderful. Why clutter your life with stuff you don’t need? Here, from t<a href="http://www.bartleby.com/2/2/">he golden sayings of Epictetus</a> are words from the original Stoic himself: </p><blockquote><p>Take what relates to the body as far as the bare use warrants—as meat, drink, raiment, house <strong>and servants</strong>. But all that makes for show and luxury reject.</p></blockquote><p>Wait a second…<em>servants</em> ? The <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2012/12/decentralization-in-ancient-world.html">ancient Greeks</a>, in the philosophical school that <em>invented</em> minimalism, says you need servants as much as food and shelter?!</p><p><a title="Discourses - Epictetus (illustration 1).jpg by impulsenine, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/impulsenine/9021700938"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2825/9021700938_046d3aa61b_n.jpg" alt="Discourses - Epictetus (illustration 1).jpg" width="233" height="320" /></a></p>
