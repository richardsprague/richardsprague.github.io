Amazon wants to share the "pi", so they're giving half of 3.14, i.e. 1.57% discount to <a href="http://news.com.com/Amazon offers discount to A9 search users/2100-1032_3-5371839.html?tag=nefd.hed">search users</a>.
<br />
<br />The A9 engine uses Google in the back end, so it's not a big deal to use it instead of Google.
