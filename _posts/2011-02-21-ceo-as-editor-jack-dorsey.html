I often listen to <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/edcorner/uploads/podcast/EducatorsCorner.xml">Stanford’s Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders podcast</a>, but there's a particularly good one this month with Jack Dorsey. &nbsp;Best known as the co-founder of Twitter, he’s a wonderful speaker: short, clear, to-the-point, with great takeaways like:<br /><blockquote>“Make every detail perfect, and limit the number of details.”<br />“Expect the unexpected; and wherever possible, be the unexpected.”</blockquote>He wraps this in the idea of “CEO as editor”, how leaders should be responsible for the <em>story</em> of their organization: hiring (the cast), internal and external communication, and attracting customers and investors. Apple, he reminds us, is one of the truly great story-telling organizations: their business cycle revolves around events and unveilings.<br />His talk is about 30 minutes: perfect for a commute.<br /><embed allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="config=http://ecorner.stanford.edu/embeded_config.xml%3Fmid%3D2594" height="303" id="single" src="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/swf/player-ec.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500"></embed>
