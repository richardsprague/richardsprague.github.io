Which is more important: a wide variety of products so you can find exactly what you want, or a smaller number so you can easily choose?  Sometimes overall sales actually increase when you lower the number of choices people have to make.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.dynamist.com/weblog/archives/001756.html">Dynamist Blog: Managing Choice</a> explains that some product categories (e.g. cereal, shampoo) balance this well, but other categories offer too much choice (e.g. computers, cell phone plans). I bet cell phone sales would go up if there were fewer plans to choose from.
