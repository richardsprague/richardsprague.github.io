<p>What&nbsp;to get for the couple who has it all? &nbsp;<a href="http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2007/08/06/big_families/index.html">Salon as a nice discussion</a> of that <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12513004">NPR piece</a> about how the big trend among rich people is to have more children:</p> <blockquote> <p>Historically, the country-club set has had the smallest number of kids. But in the past 10 years, the number of high-end earners who are having three or more kids has shot up nearly 30 percent. </p> <p>Some say the trend is driven by a generation of over-achieving career women who have quit work and transferred all of their competitive energy to baby making.  <p>They call it "competitive birthing."</p></blockquote> <p>The Salon author is critical of the&nbsp;NPR piece, and of women who choose to raise large families.&nbsp; Real women, she thinks, "enjoy getting out of their houses, care about what they do professionally, like having a life outside their family, and value their economic independence, not to mention an identity not directly linked to their ovaries." <p>In a&nbsp;hundred years, is anybody going to know or care what your identity was?&nbsp; Whether you are a man or a woman, the only part of you that will really last is the children you raise. Throughout history, children have always been the ultimate luxury.
