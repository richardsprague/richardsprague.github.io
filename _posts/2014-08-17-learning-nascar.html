<p>I’m in Michigan this weekend, experiencing as much authentic America as I can. After too much of a lifetime spent out of the country, I need to raise <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2012/02/coming-apart-from-my-children.html">my Coming Apart</a> score. And how better to do than than watch the latest NASCAR Sprint Cup race at the <a href="http://www.mispeedway.com/?homepage=true">Michigan International Speedway</a>?</p><p>NASCAR is much bigger than you might think if you’re not in their core audience. One of of three Americans is a fan (<a href="http://www.cfnews13.com/article/news/2012/february/383766/Are-women-flocking-to-NASCAR">40% of whom</a> are women). Although the National Football League takes in way more revenue overall (<a href="http://davepear.com/blog/2012/03/the-real-business-of-sports/">$9B vs. $650M</a>), NASCAR earns $3B in sponsorship revenue each year (<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/steveodland/2012/02/27/nascars-back/">twice as much as the N</a>FL). </p><p>We’re fans of Joey Logano, so it was nice to see him finish the race in the top three today. (Here’s his car, traveling at 200+ mph and captured on my iPhone5s “burst” mode).</p><p><a title="View 'https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3890/14766122850_cb8e211947.jpg' on Flickr.com" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sprague/14766122850"><img title="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3890/14766122850_cb8e211947.jpg" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3890/14766122850_cb8e211947.jpg" alt="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3890/14766122850_cb8e211947.jpg" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p><p>I’m probably not ready to devote myself whole-hog to becoming a NASCAR fan, but I’m glad I experienced a race like this. If you want to understand the real America, you could do worse than to spend some time with the 100,000+ people who packed today’s stadium with me.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
