Wired 13.05 asks you to <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.05/realestate.html">Crack the Real Estate Code</a> by guessing the effectiveness of 10 terms commonly used in real estate ads.  I got them all right.
<br />
<br />Note that the authors of the article, Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, are notable now for their new book Freakonomics, which has been positively reviewed by <a href="http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=3960469">Economist </a>and others.  They also publish a lively <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog.php">blog </a>that keeps many of these questions up to date.
