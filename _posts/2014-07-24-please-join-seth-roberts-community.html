Another big thing&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2014/04/seth-liked-people-who-think-for.html">I miss</a>&nbsp;about Seth Roberts is the interesting new links he always seemed to uncover from around the web. &nbsp;He discovered most of the links himself, but much of it came from his various friends and followers who emailed him pointers.<br /><br />The friends and followers are still around, but without his blog to send to, we're hanging out on a Google Community instead. Please join us, especially whenever you find news you think would be of interest to people thinking outside the box about wellness, personal science, or other generally under-reported ideas: &nbsp;<a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/101301560863575453174">Seth Roberts Community</a>
