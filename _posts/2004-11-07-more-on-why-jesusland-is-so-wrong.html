More on why Jesusland is a stupid, irrelevant concept that says more about liberals than it says about reality:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/06/opinion/06brooks.html?oref=login">David Brooks</a> points out correctly that "evangelicals" make up the same proportion of the electorate that they did in 2000.  There was no increase in the percentage of voters who say they pray daily.
<br />
<br /><blockquote>[T]he same insularity that caused many liberals to lose touch with the rest of the country now causes them to simplify, misunderstand and condescend to the people who voted for Bush. If you want to understand why Democrats keep losing elections, just listen to some coastal and university town liberals talk about how conformist and intolerant people in Red America are. It makes you wonder: why is it that people who are completely closed-minded talk endlessly about how open-minded they are?</blockquote>
<br />Amen.
