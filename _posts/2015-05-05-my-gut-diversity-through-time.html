<p>Clark Ellis posts a nice summary of his uBiome results over at the <a href="http://www.ubiomeblog.com/gut-wars/">uBiome Blog</a> and now, with more detail at <a href="https://autodidactauthor.wordpress.com/2015/05/05/gut-wars-diversity-2/">The Self-Taught Author blog</a>. A long period of antibiotic use has made him acutely interested in the understanding gut diversity, so he asks others to post their uBiome diversity results too.</p> <p>Here’s mine:</p> <p><a href="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PNeM2JJasxQ/VUj9rBhoK8I/AAAAAAADBJI/DD4-LJKgWyc/s1600-h/Untitled_Clipping_050515_102713_AM%25255B5%25255D.jpg"><img title="Untitled_Clipping_050515_102713_AM" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Untitled_Clipping_050515_102713_AM" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fKAUX-vRhCY/VUj9tSFCC_I/AAAAAAADBJQ/W-0c-aCIM7k/Untitled_Clipping_050515_102713_AM_thumb%25255B3%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="454" height="369"></a></p> <p>A few caveats:</p> <ul> <li>These values only represent the <em>identified</em> results, which generally bounce from about 70% (at the genus level) to 95% (phylum). There could well be dozens, perhaps thousands, of other unique bacteria that are simply too rare to be counted by the uBiome technology.</li> <li>A single bacterium can have a big effect, so it probably doesn’t mean much to look at raw counts. Remember that the mammalian genus <em>canis</em> includes wolves, coyotes, and jackals in addition to your trusty dog Fido. Simply knowing there’s a <em>canis</em> at the door tells you nothing about whether it’s safe to go out.</li> <li>Species information is (probably) meaningless. uBiome uses 16S rRNA technology that can’t differentiate below the genus level. They don’t even post species information on their web viewer; you have to uncover it from the raw data like I did. They claim it’s “experimental”, which I interrupt to mean they apply some statistical “guess”, perhaps based on general trends. Anyway, you shouldn’t rely on it.</li></ul> <p>Something strange happened in my June sample, which was taken three weeks after the one from May, in what was frankly a boring period of my life (no travel, no unusual food, no camping, etc.). It’s possible that result was simply a mistake.</p> <p>Note: all of my data is <a href="https://github.com/richardsprague/uBiome/tree/master/Data">posted on GitHub</a>, and you’re welcome to explore it and compare to your heart’s content as long as you promise to let me know if you find anything interesting!</p>
