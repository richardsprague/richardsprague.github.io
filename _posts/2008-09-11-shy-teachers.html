<p>I think the <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/09/bellevue-teachers-strike.html">Bellevue teachers strike</a> is horrible. I don't care what the issues are in this dispute, the real competition is global, with kids in other countries and districts where the teachers and administrators are hard at work today.&nbsp; </p> <p>So as I was driving down 148th SE in Bellevue this morning, and I saw teams of strikers waving at those of us doing our part to help (not hurt) global competition, I came prepared with a sign, hand-written by my 6-year-old: "Teachers go back to work!!!".&nbsp; I also had my camera ready, because I wanted to see how they respond.</p> <p>Then a funny thing happened: they immediately covered their faces with signs! </p> <p>Does anybody know why?&nbsp; In repressive countries the authorities like to send cameramen into crowds of protesters as a way to intimidate them, but <a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch1s9.html">this is America</a>. If you are publicly exercising your right to free speech, why would you be afraid to have your photo taken?</p> <p>I'm assuming that they don't mind photos taken by journalists or TV crews.&nbsp; (Or maybe with "real news media" the strike leaders are able to arrange that only certain photos are taken).</p> <p>I have a theory: many (most?) of the strikers find the picket line a little demeaning. They think of themselves as professionals just like me. They think striking is for unskilled coal miners, or for those who have no other job options.&nbsp; They also know personally the students and parents they are hurting with this strike, and they are, well, a little ashamed.</p> <p><a title="Bellevue teachers picket" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/2849454061/"><img alt="Bellevue teachers picket" src="http://static.flickr.com/3050/2849454061_7a80e87987.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
