<p>Too bad that, as far as I know, I am no relation to Frank J. Sprague (1857-1934), an assistant to Thomas Edison. According to the <a href="http://www.edisontechcenter.org/">Edison Tech Center</a>: </p><blockquote>Edison's primary interest was in light, while Sprague was interested in power. He resigned his position after about a year and started the Sprague Electric Railway &amp; Motor Company in 1884. During the next two years, Sprague produced a number of inventions of major significance.</blockquote><p>Eventually Edison Electric ended up using so many of Sprague's inventions that they decided to merge the two companies into one: General Electric.</p><p>How's that for imagination at work?</p><p><img title="GELogo.png" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-BlJFchKUNAA/UPnQeF3L49I/AAAAAAACndk/Dnb09QtKLoY/GELogo.png?imgmax=800" alt="GE Logo" width="68" height="68" border="0" /></p>
