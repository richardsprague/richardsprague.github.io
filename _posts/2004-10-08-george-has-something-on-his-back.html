<a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/10/08/bulge/index_np.html">Salon.com </a> and <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/oct/oct08.html">others </a>are gossipping about a photo of George W. in the first debate that shows something apparently under his suit jacket. Of course the implication is that he has a tiny radio transmitter and that he's cheating on the debate questions.

<br />Spread the news!  George W Bush is so dumb he has to cheat!  Don't take him seriously--he's not very bright.  Yes, that's right: his IQ is lower than Kerry's!  Repeat as needed.
