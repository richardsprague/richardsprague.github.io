<p>There are two major ways we humans express ourselves: books and conversations.</p>  <p>A well-written book has the advantages of being an exhaustive treatment of a complex topic, but sometimes the length or completeness of a book is inappropriate. “I just asked him for a simple reply to my email but he wrote a novel instead.” If that novel wasn’t exactly what I was looking for, the effort to understand and then respond to it is greater than whatever result I’m hoping to get back.</p>  <p>A conversation, on the other hand, is tentative and ephemeral. If I speak poorly, you can ask me for clarification; if I make an error, you can correct me. A conversation, by definition, is a collaborative act. A one-sided conversation is an oxymoron.</p>  <p>Some conversations are just idle chit-chat, a way to pass the time; but a good conversation, like a good book, leads somewhere, bringing you to an ending that feels like progress on the road of life. </p>  <p>Social networking services are moving us more to a <i>conversational</i> lifestyle rather than a book-like <i>consumption </i>lifestyle. A blog isn’t much fun if nobody responds to what I write; Twitter and Facebook resemble blogs except they’ve made the interactivity—the conversational aspects—much easier.</p>  <p>A book is the distillation of a long series of conversations. A well-written book has value because it saves the reader the time it would have taken to have the conversations that led to the conclusions in the book.</p> <a title="Book Drop: No Books, Please by mtsofan, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mtsofan/2299197706/"><img alt="Book Drop: No Books, Please" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3258/2299197706_6bc344c4fc.jpg" width="380" height="500" /></a>  <p>Photo thanks to <a title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mtsofan/" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mtsofan/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/mtsofan/</a></p>
