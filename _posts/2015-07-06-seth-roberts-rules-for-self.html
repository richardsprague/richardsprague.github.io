Digging through the blog of the late <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2014/04/remembering-seth-roberts.html">Seth Roberts</a>, I find many gems. Here is his concise summary of how to do self-experimentation. He mentions intending to write a book about this, but as far as I know it was never finished:<br /><blockquote>if you want to figure something out via data collection:<br />1. Do something. Don’t give up before starting.<br />2. Keep doing something. Science is more drudgery than scientists usually say.<br />3. Be minimal.<br />4. Use scientific tools (e.g., graphs), but don’t listen to scientists who say don’t do X or Y.<br />5. Post your results.</blockquote>&nbsp;Worth reading the entire<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2007/01/08/methodological-lessons-from-self-experimentation-part-4-of-4/"> four-part blog post</a>.
