<p>Everybody knows that the Washington Department of Transportation web site has a <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/traffic/seattle/flowmaps/bridges.htm">detailed traffic map</a>, updated in real-time to show how long your commute will be.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's nice if you take&nbsp;the freeways, but what about the side&nbsp;streets?&nbsp; I&nbsp;just found out that the City of Bellevue has a network of road sensors and traffic cameras that let you see at a <a href="http://trafficmap.cityofbellevue.net/">street level what the traffic</a> is:</p> <p><img src="http://trafficmap.cityofbellevue.net/maps/TrafficFlowData_W2K3IGISPR0156886516185.JPG"> </p> <p>Can't wait to try this the next time I see the freeways covered in black clog.</p>
