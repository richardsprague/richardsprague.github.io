<p>The <a href="http://www.ubiomeblog.com/microbiome-and-income/">uBiome blog posts</a> the results of a large (n&gt;500) study of their users that shows a fascinating relationship between household income and a large change in a particular bacterium, the non-pathogenic Genus 713, <em>actinobacillus.</em> Their number crunching shows that wealthy people are far less likely to have this organism in their guts. For the statistically-minded, it’s a p-value of 0.00001 – as near to scientific certainty as you can get. If you have it, you’re poor. If not, you’re wealthy.</p> <p>Obviously upon hearing this my first step was to check <a href="https://github.com/richardsprague/uBiome">my own uBiome results</a> to see if I have any <em>actinobacillus</em> (which, incidentally, <a href="http://www.tgw1916.net/Pasteurella/porcinus.html">was first isolated</a> from the respiratory tracts of pigs). </p> <p>Answer: no!&nbsp; My <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2015/03/what-potato-starch-really-did-to-my-gut.html">latest sample</a> shows no Genus 713!&nbsp; I must be rich!</p> <p>But wait, I <em>did</em> have a smidge (under 0.0008%) in <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2014/10/whats-in-my-microbiome.html">the sample</a> I submitted last May. Fortunately it cleared up by the following month and I’ve been Genus 713-free ever since! Obviously my microbiome is responding in advance to the large jackpot it knows I’ll be receiving any day now.</p> <p>Now that science has demonstrated my wealth with such certainty, I am feeling extra generous today. Instead of money, I’ll share this comic (from the always excellent <a href="https://xkcd.com/882/">XKCD</a>) which explains why they found this unassailable correlation between wealth and the microbiome:</p> <p><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/significant.png" width="458" height="1248"></p>
