<p>Long ago, I used to make fun of people who complain of back or muscle problems. Lazy complainers I said. Then about seven or eight years ago I suffered the same thing and it was sooo awful that I swore I’d be much more careful with my musculo-skeletal system, and I became very sympathetic toward others who have similar problems.&#160; When the pain hits, you can’t think about anything else and you really become handicapped.&#160; Not fun.</p>  <p>Fortunately somehow I escaped further problems until now. While picking up my laptop the other day, I felt a sharp pain in my lower back and it basically has been there ever since.&#160; It was bad enough that I’ve now gone back for several treatments with a chiropractor, Dr. Jeff Pardon from <a href="http://mercerislandchiro.com/">Mercer Island Chiropractic</a>.</p>  <p><a title="020" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42494318@N00/3714143354/"><img border="0" alt="020" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3522/3714143354_361bce2c79.jpg" width="462" height="349" /></a></p>  <p>Jeff is extremely friendly and articulate, patiently explaining the ins and outs of the spinal system and its affect on health but I’m&#160; never sure how much to trust the whole field of chiropractics.&#160;&#160; Is it an art or a science?&#160; I’m moving to China in a few weeks, so I can’t get on a treatment protocol for long-term relief anyway, and I’m not sure if anything will eliminate the risk of this pain happening again.&#160;&#160; </p>  <p>Meanwhile I just have to be extra careful. </p>
