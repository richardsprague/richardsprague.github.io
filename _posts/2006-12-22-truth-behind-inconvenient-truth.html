<p>We finally watched <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em>, which is required viewing for anybody who wants an easy-to-understand introduction to the facts behind climate change.&nbsp;Thankfully, this is <em>not</em>&nbsp;a political, Bush-bashing movie like <em>Fahrenheit 911,&nbsp;</em>nor is it fact-stretching&nbsp;in the name of humor, like&nbsp;<a href="http://richardsprague.blogspot.com/2005/07/debunking-super-size-me_08.html">Supersize Me</a>.&nbsp; There were one or two brief political jabs, but they were&nbsp;quite appropriate considering who made the movie.&nbsp; </p> <p>There are plenty of sites out there that attempt to give a counter-argument, but none are convincing.&nbsp; Just one example is a <a href="http://www.heartland.org/PrinterFriendly.cfm?theType=artId&amp;theID=17181">publication by The Heartland Institute</a> that tries to refute the claim (mentioned in the movie) by the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5702/1686">journal Science</a> that not a single peer-reviewed scientific publication has published evidence in the past ten years that contradicts global warming. This claim should be easy to disprove: produce just one contradictory peer-reviewed&nbsp;article.&nbsp; Instead, the bashers point to a vaguely-defined survey of "climatologists" who say there is controversy.&nbsp; No refuting facts, just instilling an ill-defined mood of skepticism where there is none.</p> <p>Still, I was disappointed to hear that Al Gore, in a desparate attempt to increase profits for the movie, has himself been actively trying to warm the earth through shameful activities such as this:</p> <p><img height="292" src="http://www.theonion.com/content/files/images/Al-Gore-R.jpg" width="441"></p> <p>Aparently he's even making a pathetic attempt to jump up and down on the Greenland ice shelf to hasten its slide into the ocean.&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;For the full story, click here:</p> <div class="onion_embed headline"><a class="img" href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/56631?utm_source=Distributed&amp;utm_medium=Embedded%2BHTML&amp;utm_campaign=Widgets" target="theonion"><img alt="Al Gore Caught Warming Globe To Increase Box Office Profits" src="http://www.theonion.com/content/files/images/Al-Gore-thumb.frontpage_thumbnail_small.jpg.jpg"></a> <h2><a href="http://www.theonion.com/content?utm_source=Distributed&amp;utm_medium=Embedded%2BHTML&amp;utm_campaign=Widgets" target="theonion"><img height="12" alt="The Onion" src="http://www.theonion.com/content/themes/onion/assets/logos/onion_super_tiny.png" width="92"></a></h2> <h3><a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/56631?utm_source=Distributed&amp;utm_medium=Embedded%2BHTML&amp;utm_campaign=Widgets" target="theonion">Al Gore Caught Warming Globe To Increase Box Office Profits</a></h3> <p class="embed_teaser">Environmental officials claimed that Gore's tire fire in Akron, OH was "completely out of line."</p></div><img style="display: none" height="1" src="http://statistics.theonion.com/b/ss/theonionprod/1/H.6--NS/1234567?pe=lnk_d&amp;pev2=Al%20Gore%20Caught%20Warming%20Globe%20To%20Increase%20Box%20Office%20Profits&amp;pev1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theonion.com%2Fcontent%2Fnode%2F56631%3Futm_source%3DDistributed%26utm_medium%3DEmbedded%252BHTML%26utm_campaign%3DWidgets" width="1"> <style type="text/css">.onion_embed{ background:rgb(256,256,256)!important;border:4px solid rgb(65,160,65);border-width:4px 0 1px 0;margin:10px 30px!important;padding:5px;overflow:hidden!important;zoom:1;}.onion_embed img{ border:0!important;}.onion_embed a{display:inline;}.onion_embed a.img{ float:left!important;margin:0 5px 0 0!important;width:66px;display:block;overflow:hidden!important;}.onion_embed a.img img{border:1px solid #222!important;width:64px;padding:0!important;;}.onion_embed h2{ line-height:2px;clear:none;margin:0!important;padding:0!important;}.onion_embed h3{ line-height:16px;font:bold 16px arial,sans-serif!important;margin:3px 0 0 0!important;padding:0!important;}.onion_embed h3 a{ line-height:16px!important;color:rgb(0,51,102)!important;font:bold 16px arial,sans-serif!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline!important;float:none!important;text-transform:capitalize!important;}.onion_embed h3 a:hover{ text-decoration:underline!important;color:rgb(204,51,51)!important;}.onion_embed p{color:#000!important;font:normal 11px/11px arial,sans-serif!important;margin:2px 0 0 0!important;padding:0!important;}.onion_embed a{display:inline!important;float:none!important;}</style> <img style="display: none" height="0" src="http://track.theonion.com/onion.php?type=embedded_widget&amp;title=" width="0">
