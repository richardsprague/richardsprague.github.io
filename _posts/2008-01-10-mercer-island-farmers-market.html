<p>A group of citizens are trying to create a <a href="http://www.islandvision.org/index.php?title=Farmers_Market">farmers market for Mercer Island</a>, an absolutely wonderful idea that is long overdue.&nbsp; I can't make it to tonight's planning meeting (Jan 10th, 7pm at the library), but here are my ideas:</p> <p>First, I think the focus should be on <em>variety -- </em>diversity in products (of course), but also vendors, geography, and processing.&nbsp; Locally-grown, farm fresh produce is great, but rather than simply imitate <a href="http://www.wafarmersmarkets.com/market_directory.aspx">other local farmers markets</a> that overflow with aisle after aisle of similar vendors hawking the same fruits and vegetables, how about just one or two of those, plus some or all of the following:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Dairy:</strong> <a href="http://www.kaleberg.com/creamery/index.html">Dungeness Valley Creamery</a> already delivers extremely fresh, <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/08/raw-milk.html">unprocessed milk, cheese, and cream to Mercer Island</a> each week.&nbsp; Ask them to set up a stand and sell it to the public. <li><strong>Kosher and halal</strong>: micro-scale cooking, like from Kafe Kineret: falafel, real Matzo Ball soup, shawarma.  <li><strong>Tofu:</strong> freshly-made tofu tastes completely different from that yuk stuff you get at Safeway or Whole Foods.  <li><strong>Grains:</strong> Koshihikari rice (order through Uwajimaya) or barley or whole wheat, ground for you on the spot?  <li><strong>Coffee</strong>: Maybe <a href="http://www.trabantcoffee.com/">Trabant</a> could do a tasting menu?&nbsp; or bring one of their Clover machines for us to try?  <li><strong>Spices</strong>: invite <a href="http://worldspice.com/home/home.shtml">World Spice Merchants</a> from Seattle or other small vendors who will sell small samplers in bulk.  <li><strong>Rain Forest fruits</strong>: find a supplier who can provide samples; nobody wants to risk ordering a large quantity without trying it first.  <li><strong>Meat</strong>: Alligator meat, goose, black bear?&nbsp; Invite <a href="http://www.exoticmeats.com/">Exotic Meats</a> from Bellevue to provide samplers. </li></ul> <p>Remember, you can get a lot of the fresh vegetables and locally-grown produce delivered to your door through services like <a href="http://www.pioneerorganics.com/">Pioneer Organics</a> (and without encouraging more driving, the way a farmers market does), so I hope that rather than displace these other excellent services, the Mercer Island Farmers Market can serve as a catalyst to expose more people to the joys of super-fresh food, increasing the market for everyone.</p> <p><a title="" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/60087627@N00/2173053189/"><img height="342" alt="" src="http://static.flickr.com/2070/2173053189_c14641ac4f.jpg" width="383" border="0"></a></p>
