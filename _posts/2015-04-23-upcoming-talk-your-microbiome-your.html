<p>If you’re in the Seattle area on April 29th, I hope you’ll come to a talk I’ll be giving for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theSTEAMvent">The STEAM Vent</a>, a local science event organizer. I’ll present the latest that I’ve learned about the microbiome, including the results of a bunch of <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2015/03/what-potato-starch-really-did-to-my-gut.html">self-experiments</a> I’ve done since last year to understand more and learn how to manipulate my own microbial environment.</p> <p>I’m super-excited that uBiome has generously offered a bunch of prizes for attendees, including free uBiome gut kits (worth $89) and some t-shirts. </p> <p>The event will be held at <a href="http://tsmchughs.com/">T.S. McHugh’s</a>, an Irish Pub/Restaurant near the Space Needle. They’re offering a special “microbe-friendly” meal beforehand, an entrée that includes fresh sauerkraut and other healthy bacterial cultures for those who want to feed their microbes.</p> <p>My talk starts at 7:30, and The STEAM Vent charges an admission fee of $10. But I strongly encourage you to come a little earlier for the meal ($25, including admission).</p> <p>Find out more at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-STEAM-Vent/events/221855759/">Meetup page</a>.</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/e/4/e/global_431900046.jpeg"></p>
