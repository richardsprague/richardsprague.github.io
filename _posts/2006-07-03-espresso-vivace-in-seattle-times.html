I'm not kidding when I say that a non-zero percentage of the reason I moved from Silicon Valley to Seattle was to be closer to Espresso Vivace, one of the world's best coffee houses, according to the Financial Times.<br /><img src="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/ABPub/2006/06/28/2003074184.jpg" /><br />David Schomer, the 50-year-old coffee-obsessed owner in this photo, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/PrintStory.pl?document_id=2003099339&slug=vivace02&amp;date=20060702">was featured </a>in an article in the Seattle Times this weekend. They just opened a new store, across from REI, because the one I usually visit on Capital Hill is being taken over by a light rail station.<br /><br />The coffee is not only incredibly good, but incredibly, it's cheaper than Starbucks. Why Mercer Island doesn't have a true gourmet coffee place instead of the dozen or so Starbucks we have now, is beyond me.
