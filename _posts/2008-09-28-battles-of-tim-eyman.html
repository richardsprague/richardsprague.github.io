<p>Although I first heard about this documentary film back in February, when the director Paul Fraser came to a <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/02/challenging-global-warming-skeptics.html">Global Warming lecture</a> at the Mercer Island library, I didn’t get around to watching it until yesterday, after seeing it <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/PrintStory.pl?document_id=2008191536&amp;zsection_id=2008183640&amp;slug=eymanmovie20m&amp;date=20080920">mentioned in the paper</a> last week.&#160; As you know, I’m a fan of all things local:&#160; I think everyone in Washington state, at least anyone interested in state/local politics should watch it too.</p>  <p>Tim Eyman is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Eyman">an activist famous for leading</a> numerous state-wide ballot initiatives (referendums), mostly in the name of lowering taxes and limiting the power of government.&#160; His claims to fame are various initiatives over the past ten years that ended up lowering car licensing fees and requiring a 2/3rds majority in state legislature to raise taxes.&#160; He says his initiatives have reduced taxes over $11B, but he doesn’t just fight taxes. He also successfully led an effort to reduce the size of the King County City Council, and his organization, <a href="http://www.permanent-offense.org/">Permanent Offense</a>, has fought for various issues related to transportation, including the I-985 (“reduce traffic congestion”) bill that will be on the November 4th ballot.</p>  <p>Although it’s clear the director thinks Eyman is an intriguing, newsworthy guy, this is <em>not</em> a propaganda film, and I find it hard to tell which side he’s on. There are interviews with Eyman himself and supporters like Mercer Island’s Michael Medved who portray him as a “man of the people” trying to “take back the government”.&#160; But these are nicely balanced with persuasive arguments for how citizen-led mass referendums can lead to a lack of accountability.&#160; The film includes lengthy personal interviews with opponents like State Senator <a href="http://senatedemocrats.wa.gov/jacobsen.htm">Ken Jacobson</a> (D), radio personality <a href="http://www.bjaday.com/">BJ Shea</a>, and even David Goldstein, whose popular far-left blog is actually named after an initiative started expressly to have Tim Eyman declared a <a href="http://www.horsesass.org/">Horse’s ass</a>.</p>  <p>The film’s not perfect.&#160; I wish there had been more biography for example; I kept hoping there’d be a segment explaining Eyman’s non-activist background (where does he get his money?&#160; what’s his day job?)&#160; At nearly two hours, I found it a bit long; a tougher editor could have turned this into a shorter made-for-TV film that would be more widely watched – as it deserves.</p>  <p>It’s on <a href="http://www.netflix.com/Movie/The_Battles_of_Tim_Eyman/70102660?trkid=188469">Netflix, so put it in your queue</a> right now.&#160; <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/06/why-you-should-not-vote.html">Don’t vote in November</a> until you’ve seen it.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><iframe style="width: 120px; height: 240px" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=richasprag-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=B001DAVU96&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;m=amazon&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
