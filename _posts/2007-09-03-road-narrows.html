<p>This sign greeted us when we returned from last week's vacation:</p> <p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1255/1316863849_decc307fb4.jpg?v=0"> </p> <p>It's on a street not far from our house.&nbsp; The neighbors, especially those with children, have been wanting it for a long time because too many cars like to tumble down this hill at full speed, unaware children and bicyclists might be ahead. At the narrowest section, it's effectively a one-way street so cars often find themselves head-to-head.</p> <p>Do you recognize this street?&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ci.mercer-island.wa.us/members.asp?memberid=589">Dan Grausz</a>, on Mercer Island City Council does. He helped the neighbors get that sign. He's a good city councilman.&nbsp; Guess how <a href="http://web.pdc.wa.gov/">much he raised for his last re-election</a>?&nbsp; Answer: $7500, virtually all of it in small donations from local people.&nbsp;None of it from big off-island special interest organizations.</p> <p>Everything is local, in politics and in the rest of life. Mercer Island's not a big&nbsp;place.&nbsp; I wonder how many of the candidates in this year's City Council election can name this street?&nbsp; I wonder how many of them ever <em>been on</em> this street?&nbsp;If I were on the Seattle Times editorial board, that'd be one of my questions to people like <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/08/off-islanders-for-maureen-judge.html">Maureen Judge</a>, <a href="http://www.voteforcero.org/">Mike Cero</a>, <a href="http://www.electbruce.org/">Bruce Bassett</a>, <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/08/city-council-position-3-debate.html">Patti Darling</a>:&nbsp; can you name this street?&nbsp; </p>
