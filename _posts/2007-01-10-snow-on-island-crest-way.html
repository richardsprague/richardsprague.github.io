<p>There are cars littered all over i-90, most of them parked quite orderly at the side of the road. Did they just run out of gas in the terrible, unmoving traffic?&nbsp; It took me almost five hours to get home, ultimately whizzing past a bus stuck on Island Crest Way just south of Merrimount.&nbsp; Here's what&nbsp;this evening's <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003518001_webweather10.html">Seattle Times</a>&nbsp;says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Pea-sized hail began to fall on Mercer Island about 4:30 p.m., laying a coat of ice. At the Island Crest exit, traffic was immediately stopped before the hill.</p> <p>The central business district was gridlock by 5:15 p.m. The streets didn't appear to be snowy or icy, but on the back streets heading south on the island, there was a school bus stuck sideways with a firetruck to the rescue on SE 40th Street. Cars were going 3 mph and people were leaving their cars and walking. There were two Sound Metro buses stuck on Island Crest Way.</p></blockquote> <p>&nbsp;At 9:30pm I didn't find any problems getting up Island Crest -- maybe they salted it or something to make it very passable. But the temperatures are falling so I bet the morning's going to be a doozy of a commute. <p>Other than the crummy driving, it's kindda pretty outside.&nbsp; Here's what my back yard looks like: <p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/353543491_b63888917a.jpg?v=0">
