<p>Five years ago, the <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/12/clover-factory.html">Clover Coffee Equipment company</a> was hand-assembling high-tech, excellent automatic coffee-making machines for the super high-end market. At tens of thousands of dollars each, they were intended for sale to boutique coffee shops, like <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/11/clover-coffee.html">Trabant</a> and others, who could sell wonderful, precision-made cups of coffee to people who can appreciate the quality interaction of specialty beans, brewing times and temperatures.</p> <p>Clover’s “factory” was an ordinary-looking building in Seattle’s Fremont district (very close to today’s <a href="http://www.makerhaus.com/">MakerHaus</a> by the way) and the founders were people who had a passion for the intersection of (industrial) design and the precision coffee experience. Those of us who knew the company and its products thought it was a great idea, and eventually Starbucks agreed when <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/03/clover-coffee-sells-to-man.html">it bought them out</a>.</p> <p>How would you build something like Clover today? Well, I just saw the perfect example on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1708005089/picobrew-zymatic-the-automatic-beer-brewing-applia">Kickstarter</a>: the <a href="http://picobrew.azurewebsites.net/">PycoBrew Zymatic</a> beer brewing appliance. At a high level, the hardware reminds me of the Clover: pumps, temperature sensors, relays, heating. Otherwise, instead of coffee beans, it uses grain and malt.<img src="http://picobrew.azurewebsites.net/images/picobrewzymatic.jpg" width="438" height="222"></p> <p>But the really exciting difference is the fantastic new business model that’s been enabled by Kickstarter. Whereas Clover had to be financed through (some deep-pocketed) angels and other traditional investors, PycoBrew can get its startup capital through its first customers. Through a pledge of about $1,500, the people interested in the product can help the new company financially right now, when it has no revenues.</p> <p>Like the Clover founders, the people of PycoBrew seem very serious: their web site documents their progress through multiple generations of functional prototypes. To manufacture something that complicated, and then ship and support it around the country is a very big deal – the kind of business that in the past would have required (tens of?) millions of dollars up-front.</p> <p>Think of a bread machine, only instead of bread you get beer. The basic idea is straightforward, and I personally know dozens, maybe hundreds of engineers who are entirely capable of building such a thing – or zillions of other similarly-interesting or useful products. But a great idea is useless without a profitable business to carry it out. Kickstarter and the wonderful set of internet-enabled ideas that go behind it, is lowering the costs and upfront hassles of actually starting and running the business side of ideas.</p> <p>I can’t wait to see what additional new products we’ll see thanks to the new, really cool business innovation behind this.</p>
