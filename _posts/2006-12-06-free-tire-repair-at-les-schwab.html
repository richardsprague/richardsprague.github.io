<p>Somehow my tire ran over a nail yesterday and, poof, it was flat. I want to sell the car soon, so I'm not interested in a new set of tires or anything -- I just want to quickly get myself back on the road as soon as possible.</p> <p>Imagine my surprise when I dropped into <a href="http://g.msn.com/9SE/1?http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&amp;ss=ypid.YN925x20935978_les+schwab+tires_Bellevue%2c+WA&amp;style=r&amp;s_cid=ansPhBkYp02&amp;&amp;DI=6244&amp;IG=124bcfef7dc74ac2ad4c4d353d2fac24&amp;POS=2&amp;CM=PHY&amp;CE=2&amp;CS=SID&amp;SR=2">Les Schwab</a> this morning and asked them to get me a new tire. The salesman talked me out of it and instead gave me a free repair on the old one. Took about half an hour and now my tire is as good as new!</p> <p><img src="http://www.lesschwabonline.com/images/FourGuys.jpg"></p>
