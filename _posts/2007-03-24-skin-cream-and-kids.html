<p>For the past million generations, children grew up without much attention to hygiene. No toothpaste, no sunscreen, maybe just a bit of&nbsp;lard soap before a special occasion -- otherwise they just cleaned off automatically as they played inthe river.&nbsp; Now parents want to throw all kinds of chemicals at them. <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.03/start.html?pg=11">Wired has the details</a> about one popular skin cream, including this doozy:</p> <blockquote> <p><b>BENZOPHENONE</b><br>Rub this flower-scented lotion on your skin or stick your face in a diesel's tailpipe, where benzophenone is present in the exhaust. Either way, you get a nice sunscreen. If swallowed or inhaled, though, the substance may disrupt hormones and mess with your brain. Scientists — and probably industry lawyers — recommend against using it on kids.</p></blockquote> <p><img src="http://www.wired.com/ly/wired/wired/archive/15.03/images/ST_50_lotion_f.jpg"></p>
