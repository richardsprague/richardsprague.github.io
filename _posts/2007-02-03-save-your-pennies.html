<a href="http://www.chicagofed.org/publications/fedletter/cflfebruary2007_235a.pdf">A serious proposal by the Chicago Fed</a> on how to solve the problem that pennies melted for their metal content are currently worth than one cent:  Just declare that from now on pennies are worth 5 cents.  This also devalues the nickel, another coin that is almost never used and worth more for its metal.<br /><br />The Treasury Department can simply offer to exchange 20 pennies for a dollar bill, and you could watch all those pennies in circulation disappear very quickly.
