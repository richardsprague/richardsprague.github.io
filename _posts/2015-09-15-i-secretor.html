<p> The <a href="http://thegutinstitute.com/2015/08/gut-guardians-podcast-episode-24-being-10-human-w-alanna-collen.html">Gut Guardians podcast</a> interview with Alanna Collen included an interesting reference to the FUT2 gene, which the podcast hosts says has been linked to response to high fiber diets. One of the alleles, referred to as the non-secretor type, offers a <a href="http://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs601338">genetic immunity to infection</a> by the Norwalk Norovirus, also known as the “cruise ship virus”. </p><p>Alas, I’m not immune to that particular virus, but if you have to choose I think it’s better to have the “secretor allele”, like me. Overall, secretors seem less susceptible to many influenza strains and pathogenic bacteria, perhaps due to our better response to high fiber. </p><p>What’s especially interesting is that how FUT2 also seems to be associated with your microbiome.  Secretors have <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0020113&amp;representation=PDF">noticeably different levels</a> of various bacteria, including missing Bifido species that are known to play a role in health. This is another example of how genes don’t have the final say: you may not get the full benefits of being a secretor if you don’t eat enough fiber.</p><p>If you have your 23andme results, you can <a href="https://www.23andme.com/you/explorer/snp/?snp_name=rs601338">check your FUT2</a> status too.</p>
