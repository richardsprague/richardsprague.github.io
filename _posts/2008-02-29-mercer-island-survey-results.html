<p>The City of Mercer Island commissioned a study of 400 registered voters in late January, and the <a href="http://www.mercergov.org/files/AB4274.pdf">results are now posted</a> on the city web site.&nbsp; Some top level findings from the executive summary:</p> <ul> <li>Island voters continue to be in a positive mood (65% Right Direction), and their relationship with City government remains strong.  <li>Continuing a trend seen in 2006, transportation, traffic, overcrowding, and overdevelopment top the list of the most important problems. The negative rating for promoting traffic safety increased 12 percentage points in 2008.  <li>Favorable ratings for the City Council remain solid (58%), and a majority give the City positive<br>ratings for their responsible use of tax dollars (56%). The City continues to significantly outperform King County on both of these measures.  <li>Voter priorities have remained constant over the past four years, with ensuring prompt fire/medical aid response times and preventing crime at the top of the list. Protecting the environment, a new item this year, ranks third, just above maintaining streets and promoting traffic safety.  <li>The City receives strong positive ratings for almost all services tested (at least 62% positive). Only preparing for a natural disaster falls short of a majority positive rating.  <li>A majority (58%) of voters say they are prepared to go without power or water for a week. Renters feel less prepared than homeowners, voters under 50 feel less prepared than those over 50, and homes with children feel less prepared than those without children.  <li>An overwhelming percentage (86%) feel safe walking alone in their neighborhood or the town<br>center.  <li>While a strong majority of voters are satisfied with the appearance and condition of the town center (71%) a smaller majority are satisfied with the shopping and dining options there (58%).</li></ul> <p>A few other tidbits I noted:</p> <ul> <li>While 56% of residents think Mercer Island is using tax money responsibly, only 28% think the same of King County.  <li>I worry that "only" 86% of people feel safe walking alone (is crime really a concern for the others?) but when I re-read the question again I think the "unsafe" part could include fear of getting hit by a car.&nbsp; Which if you've ever walked Island Crest at night, you'll understand.</li></ul> <p>And my favorite part of the survey, the last question, asked where people get their information regarding issues.&nbsp; About half say the Mercer Island Reporter, followed a distant second by Seattle Times and "word of mouth".&nbsp; There were a bunch of other choices on there, but a full 6% said "Other".&nbsp;&nbsp; What could that possibly be?&nbsp; Oh wait, maybe they meant "Some stupid idiot's <strike>Richard Sprague's</strike> blog"!&nbsp; Ha!</p>
