<a href="http://richardsprague.blogspot.com/2005/02/eilyon-searching-for-people.html">I previously mentioned</a> Eilyon as a place to look for people on the Internet.  Apparently they've changed their name to ZoomInfo.
<br />
<br />They still don't seem to know me very much.  Type Richard Sprague Microsoft and you'll get a couple of old links from other people.
<br />
<br />Just <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rls=GGLD,GGLD:2004-14,GGLD:en&q=%22richard+sprague%22">Google me </a>and you'll see much more, like my blogs and recent info about me.
