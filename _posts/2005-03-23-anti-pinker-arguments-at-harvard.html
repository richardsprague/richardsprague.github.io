From <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=506676">The Harvard Crimson Online</a> reporting on speakers at a recent event discussing women in science:
<br />
<br />"Professor of Psychology Elizabeth S. Spelke disputed the findings of various studies used to support arguments for innate gender differences in cognition. She directed particularly vehement criticisms at Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology Steven Pinker, whose book The Blank Slate formed the basis for some of Summers' remarks about ''intrinsic aptitude.''"
