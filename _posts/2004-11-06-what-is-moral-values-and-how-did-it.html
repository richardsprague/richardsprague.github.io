Slate's Paul Freedman offers a convincing case that <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2109275/">Terrorism, not values, drove Bush's re-election.</a>
<br />
<br />Similarly, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/06/politics/campaign/06poll.html">New York Times notes</a> that the exit poll question causing the "moral values" buzz was confusing: it should have been asked as a "personal characteristic", not as an "issue" like terrorism or Iraq.  
<br />
<br />Personally, I agree with <a href="http://www.economist.com/world/na/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3358859">the Economist </a>: 
<br />
<br /><blockquote>When asked directly about their attitudes to abortion, the responses this time were no different from 2000: 55% said it should be always or mostly legal. On gay marriage, 26% approved and 35% supported civil unions. So it is possible that “moral values” are not just a matter of social conservatism but also code for trust in the candidate, or respect for a man's willingness to take a stand—where Mr Bush won easily. Mr Kerry never quite managed to persuade voters of his leadership qualities.</blockquote>
