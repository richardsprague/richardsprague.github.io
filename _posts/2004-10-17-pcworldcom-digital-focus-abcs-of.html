<br />
<br />Stowe wants to put some of her old prints into digital form, and has asked me to look into buying a scanner. A couple of observations:
<br />
<br />1. The size of each scan is enormous--at least 10MB and maybe way more if you want high quality.
<br />2. Will she want to scan negatives? or prints?
<br />
<br />If negatives, then the quality is much better, but the cost is at least $300.
