<p>The <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008080799_sun30m.html">Seattle Times today points out</a> that Washington State ranks fifth in the country for Melanoma (skin cancer), right up there with other northern long-winter places like Rhode Island and Vermont.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the sunniest states like Arizona and Florida <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/skin/statistics/state.htm">have the lowest rates</a> (according to the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/skin/statistics/state.htm">CDC</a>).</p> <p><img src="http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/00_images/skin/melenoma_incidence_map_2004.jpg"> </p> <p>Look at the <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/ABPub/2008/07/29/2008080767.pdf">PDF map of skin cancer rates</a> in Washington State.&nbsp; If I changed the title of the graph to "Rainiest places in Washington", you wouldn't know the difference:&nbsp; there's an almost direct correlation.&nbsp; Eastern Washington (Yakima, Kititas, Walla Walla -- all those sunny places in the "rain shadow") have the lowest rates while Western Washington (especially the rain forest areas of Jefferson and the Olympic Peninsula) have the highest rates.</p> <p>By the way, you can get all the local cancer data you want from the <a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/doh/wscr/WSCRQuery.aspx">Washington State Cancer Registry</a>.&nbsp; Someday when I get more time, it would be fun to pull the data and compare it to rainfall and other variables.&nbsp; For example: King County males have an incidence of 52 cases per 100,000 (females are 44).</p> <p>I'm no expert, but the standard explanation seems completely backwards to me.&nbsp; "People in northern or rainy climates forget to put on enough sunscreen, so they get burned more often--hence the higher cancer rates"?&nbsp;&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; That sounds like a classic example of a <a href="http://www.boop.org/jan/justso/">"Just So"</a> story -- data that contradicts your central thesis (sunshine causes cancer) becomes a reason to dig a deeper hole in absurd explanations rather than a chance to rethink your assumptions.</p> <p>I wonder if anyone has compared things like sunscreen sales or usage by state and location.&nbsp; Again, I have no idea about the medical research on this, but it seems to me that somebody might want to consider that it's the<em> lack of sunshine</em> that is the problem here.</p>
