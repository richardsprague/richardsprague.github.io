<p>Although it was important to show our support, the last minute work of sign-wavers probably didn't make much difference since the <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/03/why-you-should-support-school-levy.html">Capital Projects</a> Levy <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/elections/200803/Res.Htm">passed by a 68.98% margin</a>.&nbsp; Even without <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/12/simple-majority-on-mercer-island.html">Simple Majority,</a> the measure breezed through.</p> <p>Now that it's over and there's no risk of me jinxing the vote, I have a question about why we asked for so little.&nbsp; The Good People of Mercer Island say yes -- by wide margins -- to anything related to public schools, so why aren't we doing more?&nbsp; It feels good to have a measure pass by such a huge amount, but in the long run I worry that school supporters will grow lazy in two ways:</p> <ul> <li>The Yes Campaign people won't work as hard next time. We're busy with other things, so why bother with phone-a-thons or letters to the editor or sign-waving in the cold when it <strike>probably </strike>won't matter either way.</li></ul> <p>and far worse of course</p> <ul> <li>We'll be more flippant with how we propose and spend money.&nbsp; If any tax will pass no matter what, why be meticulous with how the money is spent?&nbsp; Forget repainting the school or buying new networking equipment.&nbsp; How about <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/CDA/SSA/Product/0,,a10-c440-p8,00.html">Aeron chairs</a> for all the teachers?</li></ul> <p>Consider the following mathematical facts about this year's levy results.&nbsp;&nbsp; One in four registered voters went out of their way to vote yes, either in person or through mail-in ballot, while only 10% -- a mere 1,670 people -- came out against it.</p> <p>This was a too-easy election, driven I think a little too much by fear of those 1,670 naysayers -- who probably would have voted against anything that had been on the ballot.&nbsp; Rather than focus on them, I wish we could do something bigger, bolder, more ambitious; something that would stir up the juices of the 10,000 people who didn't vote at all. That might <strike>probably would</strike> mean more money (we're only 7% tax rate vs 9% in Seattle for example), but not necessarily.&nbsp; What if we proposed something Big, like an idea for how schools in the future should be run.&nbsp; Something international, maybe, or combining technology with distance learning.&nbsp; Throw a bunch of competition into it, with big rewards for those who have the best results.</p> <p>Okay, okay, I'm just mindlessly kicking out ideas here, but you get the point.&nbsp; When we let schools, or school funding, run themselves, we are no longer pushing ourselves and that's when we start to fall behind. </p>
