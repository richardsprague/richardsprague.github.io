<p>The January 2008 Scientific American does a summary of the rethinking about flouridated drinking water, <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=second-thoughts-on-fluoride">Second Thoughts on Flouride</a>:</p> <ul> <li>Researchers are intensifying their scrutiny of fluoride, which is added to most public water systems in the U.S. Some recent studies suggest that overconsumption of fluoride can raise the risks of disorders affecting teeth, bones, the brain and the thyroid gland.  <li>A 2006 report by a committee of the National Research Council recommended that the federal government lower its current limit for fluoride in drinking water because of health risks to both children and adults.</li></ul> <p><a href="http://www.ci.mercer-island.wa.us/Page.asp?NavID=647">Mercer Island gets its water</a> from the <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/util/About_SPU/Water_System/Water_Sources_&amp;_Treatment/Cedar_River_Watershed/CEDARRIVE_200312081358174.asp">Cedar River Watershed</a> and the Tolt River Watershed, both located in eastern King County.&nbsp; Cedar River water is "Fluoridated for dental health protection", according to their web site (I couldn't find anything about flouride on the <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/util/About_SPU/Water_System/Water_Sources_&amp;_Treatment/Tolt_River_Watershed/SPU03_001889.asp">Tolt River web site</a> ).</p> <p>If you think flouride is a good idea for your kids, ask your dentist to give you special flouride drops.&nbsp; But why do all the rest of us need that extra stuff added to our water?</p>
