Surprise, surprise: kids who watch TV nag their parents for more stuff than kids who don't.  Good thing our kids never watch TV.<br /><br />From a Stanford study: <a href="http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2006/april12/med-tv-041206.html">Watch not, want not? Kids' TV time tied to consumerism</a>:<br /><br />"On average, the children reported spending more than 22 hours of screen time each week, about 10 of which was spent watching television. The remainder of the time was mostly spent playing video games online or on home video game machines, both of which incorporate increasing amounts of advertising targeted to children.<br /><br />The children fessed up to about one request each week for toys and two requests every three weeks for food or drinks. These numbers are similar to those reported in other studies."
