[from <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/technology/personal_technology/12504183.htm?source=rss&amp;channel=siliconvalley_personal_technology">MercuryNews.com</a>]  Soon you'll be able to upload your prints, then pick them up at your local Walgreens in as little as an hour, for less than the price of doing it online since there are no shipping costs.
<br />
<br />This article notes that Snapfish is the largest online photo printer, with something like 700,000 users per month.  I'm impressed that they're bigger than Kodak's Ofoto (now called Easysomething).
