<p>People born in the Fall tend to live longer than those born in the Spring. That’s the statistically significant conclusion based on a dataset of over one million people, according to a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC30243/">2001 paper by James Vaupel</a> of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research. Interestingly, the opposite is true for people born in the southern hemisphere</p> <p>Why?</p> <p>He thinks it may have something to do with the diet of the pregnant mothers, who perhaps eat better (more fresh fruits/vegetables?) in the Summer than in the Winter. But I have an easier explanation: it’s the amount of sunshine.</p> <p>Sun affects <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/09/my-vitamin-d-shortage.html">Vitamin D levels</a>, which are clearly linked to all kinds of health. And contrary to what you read, reasonable sun exposure is <em><a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/07/doubts-about-sun-exposure-and-skin.html">inversely linked to skin cancer</a></em>. It’s also possible that sunshine affects the number and type of microbes around, with some “blooming” more in the summer than winter, and maybe that has an affect too.</p> <p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-a3gs3nLHt5Q/UpJ7WYFIWlI/AAAAAAACwqo/Uk2v0sTSj7o/s1600-h/image%25255B2%25255D.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-mwmjA3V-BiM/UpJ7Xop5QXI/AAAAAAACwqw/EluJCnc2ozo/image_thumb.png?imgmax=800" width="244" height="244"></a></p>
