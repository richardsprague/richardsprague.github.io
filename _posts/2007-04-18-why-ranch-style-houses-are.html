<p>Nine of out ten new houses built in 1950 were those one-story "ranch style" homes with big front picture windows, tiny lawns, and open kitchens framed with wood paneling and simple room dividers.&nbsp; Today's Slate, <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2163970">features Witold Rybczynski</a>, author of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Last-Harvest-Development-Washington-Twenty-first/dp/0743235967/">Last Harvest: How a Cornfield Became Danville</a>, a new book dissecting the construction of a suburb.&nbsp; He explains the history of ranch homes (in California we often called them "ramblers").&nbsp; These are the highlights:</p> <ul> <li>Invented in 1932 by Cliff May, a San Diego architect</li> <li>Home sizes have grown from an average of 800 SF in 1950 to 2100 SF today (one third of new homes are over 2400 SF)</li> <li>More than half of new homes today are 2 stories and none are ranch style</li> <li>New styles: pitched roofs, gables, dormers, bay windows, keystones, shutters, porches, and paneled doors</li></ul> <p>Having lived in a ranch style house in Sunnyvale for five years, I guess I took it for granted that this was the way houses (particularly in California) are supposed to be.&nbsp; But it's nice to know that America has moved on.</p>
