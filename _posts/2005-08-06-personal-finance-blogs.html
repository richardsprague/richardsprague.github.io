Is this a new trend? People seem to bare their souls on blogs, so why not their finances too?
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.pfblog.com/">PFBlog.com - The Unique Personal Finance Weblog</a> is a site run by a guy who tells you his exact financial situation, including the amount he spends on various purchases and the return on his various portfolio investments. He is also apparently a Microsoft employee, since he mentions that in his 401(k) and stock options summaries.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/">Consumerism Commentary </a>is a similar site, though with lower assets.
