<p>Good teachers deserve to be paid a lot more than they are, and if it were up to me there’d be a huge bonus pool, with big fat raises for some of the underpaid but outstanding teachers I know.&#160; It’s no fair that the bottom 10% get to dictate how the top 10% are paid.&#160; In competitive industries (like small business, real estate, restaurants, any international company), your income is based on performance, not years of experience, which is why I I don’t think you should evaluate teachers strictly based on their number of years of experience either. But <a href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8203221&amp;postID=2498377417216632784">if you’re curious</a> how school districts compare, this chart should help:</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/richardsprague/SNURt8atlHI/AAAAAAAAArE/zBaB_f37n9A/s1600-h/image%5B4%5D.png"><img title="image" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="236" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/richardsprague/SNURuuhifqI/AAAAAAAAArI/CzzNRHNXHUU/image_thumb%5B2%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="387" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>I calculated the number of teachers in Bellevue and Mercer Island who have various numbers of years of experience.&#160;&#160; In my rush I couldn’t think of a better way to label the graph, but basically each column represents the percentage of teachers whose years of teaching experience are somewhere between the previous column and this one.</p>  <p>For example, 27% of Mercer Island teachers have between 0 and 5 years of experience, while 38% of Bellevue teachers fit that category; 23% of Mercer Island teachers have been on the job between 20 and 30 years while only 11% of Bellevue teachers have.</p>  <p>Generally speaking, Bellevue has fresher teachers than Mercer Island.&#160; Since the union-mandated payscale cares only how long somebody has been on the job, <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2007/06/better-pay-for-better-teachers.html">no matter what their competency</a> or fitness for teaching, this explains why <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/09/salaries-for-bellevue-and-mercer-island.html">Mercer Island salaries are slightly higher</a>.</p>  <p>[9/23: I updated this post a bit to explain better what I think]</p>
