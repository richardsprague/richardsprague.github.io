<p>Gary Wolf, who along with Wired Co-Founder Kevin Kelly is one of the key forces behind the <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">Quantified Self</a> movement, is writing a book on the subject.&nbsp; What started originally in 2009 as a <a href="http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/magazine/17-07/lbnp_knowthyself?currentPage=all">short article in Wired</a>, was meant to be part of a bigger project he calls the Macroscope, an emerging world of interconnected sensors that enable people to learn far more about themselves and nature. <p>The Macroscope is a nice way to tie together a set of fields which seem dissimilar at first but turn out to have a lot in common: the Internet of Things (iOT), mobile health sensors, smart cities and clothes, object tracking, even Big Data, and more. Gary Wolf sees this as a trend toward measurement and observation -- a continuation of a long history of great scientific achievements made possible by the development of new tools like telescopes or microscopes. Just as each new tool spawned a set of new discoveries and spinoff inventions, it's natural to expect unimaginably wonderful new products from the development of the Macroscope. <p>I'm interested, by contrast, in a different perspective. To me, this set of seemingly-dissimilar fields is part of another historical project, one that involves mass customization and personalization of all that we do. Thanks to technology, the human race is moving closer to our origins as small bands of highly-connected people. Each of us has our own insights, perspectives, and locally-relevant knowledge, that when properly combined makes the whole of us greater than the sums of the parts. <p>This takes the field into a different direction from the Macroscope, and ties together some other disruptive ideas which also interest me: MOOCs (Massive Open Online Course) for education, biology in
