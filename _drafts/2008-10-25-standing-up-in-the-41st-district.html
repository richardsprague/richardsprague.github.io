<p>The Mercer Island Legislative Team held an interesting discussion this week between the Washington State 41st district legislative candidates, and I came away with a different opinion of Marcie Maxwell.&#160; This was the first time I’d seen her do a public presentation – she was forceful and passionate, unlike her much quieter in-person demeanor – and I see now why she’s been a leader in Renton schools.</p>  <p>She's not a natural hand-grabbing politician like her opponent Steve Litzow, who cheerfully pressed the flesh with everyone in the room, joking and smiling like it was a birthday party. Marcie, by contrast, seemed shy and uncomfortable, barely speaking to anyone before the meeting, and leaving quickly afterwards. She doesn’t come across as very forceful or opinionated one-to-one, at least in the few brief face-to-face conversations I've had with her. &quot;Please don’t write anything bad about me&quot;, she jokes when I see her, although I can’t help thinking it sounds as much like a plea as a joke. I hope she was joking,&#160; because face it: I’m such a tiny little nit in the grand scheme of things, I’m the <em>last</em> person she should be worried about. </p>  <p>Steve smiles and talks friendly to everyone, whether they’re supporters or not.&#160; If I say something nasty about him, he’ll laugh about it or confront me later – depending on the circumstances – but I don’t feel like he takes it personally.&#160; Some people say that makes him just another sleazy politician; you never really know where he stands, because the only thing he really seems to care about is getting elected.&#160; You can’t quite tell whether he’s really passionate about the issues, or whether he’s just saying it in order to win.</p>  <p>Marcie, on the other hand, obviously cares deeply about education and she believes the best way she can help is by going to Olympia. Even if there's a small chance that my words tip the balance and prevent her side from winning, she'll feel awful, as though Washington's children have been failed.</p>  <p>But who’s a better leader?&#160; And who do you want in the legislature?&#160; </p>  <p>Marcie, I’m confident, is more focused on education (which is my number one issue). But is that really what I want?&#160; As legislator, I’m confident she’ll follow the Democratic party leadership – results or no results – because she trusts them and is soooo dependent on their support.&#160; I can’t help thinking that one reason she has so many endorsements is that all Democratic party constituencies know she’s a reliable party-line voter, who <em>won’t</em>&#160; be schmoozing with the other side, or messing with their sacred cows.&#160; Unfortunately, that means they can ignore her too.&#160; Her side has been running the Washington State education system for so long that they either need to stand on their results, or find reliable like-minded candidates like Marcie to keep them in power.</p>  <p>Steve, on the other hand, <em>needs</em> results (or at least, the <em>appearance</em> of results) or he has no support whatsoever.&#160; People like me will skewer him if he doesn’t listen to us.&#160; The unions, the special interests, the people currently in power – no matter how much they disagree with him, they have to </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>I think that’s who I want on my side too.&#160;&#160; </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>&#160;<a href="http://www.pnwlocalnews.com/east_king/mir/opinion/letters/31870134.html">Pat Braman says Steve Litzow &quot;doesn't get it</a>” because he hasn’t spent the time .</p>
