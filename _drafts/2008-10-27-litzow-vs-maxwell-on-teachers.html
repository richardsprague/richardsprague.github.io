<p>Both candidates say <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/09/shy-teachers.html">teacher strikes should be illegal</a>, though neither gave specifics on what to do about them.&#160; Steve notes that the unions seem to strike each year just before elections, and that we should expect another one two years from now, just before the next election. No suggestions for how to avoid it.</p>  <p>Marcie repeated her union supporters’ statements about how “teachers are happiest in the classroom”&#160; and that presumably the best way to ensure happiness is to pay them more.</p>  <p>But how should we pay them?&#160; I saw a big, healthy difference:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Steve:&#160; “I do believe it’s possible to tell the difference between good teachers and bad teachers” and the good ones should be rewarded.</p> </blockquote>  <blockquote>   <p>Marcie: “It’s complicated”, so why not focus on making teachers better, through things like National Board Certification or the Math Academy they tried in the Renton district.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Here Steve’s clearly right.&#160; It’s ridiculous that we give the same raises to the worst 10% of teachers as we do to the top 1%.&#160; <a href="http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/410958_NBPTSOutcomes.pdf" target="_blank">That study people quote</a> about National Board Certification is flawed because it didn’t distinguish between causation and causality: the certification doesn’t change the teacher. Marcie should read up on what <a href="http://nalert.blogspot.com/2007/02/apple-ceo-jobs-attacks-teacher-unions.html">Apple’s Steve Jobs says</a>: today’s schools will never really improve until you fix the awful way we hire and compensate teachers.</p>  <p>Mediocre teachers who want to keep their jobs should spend every waking minute of their day trying to ensure Marcie gets elected.</p>
