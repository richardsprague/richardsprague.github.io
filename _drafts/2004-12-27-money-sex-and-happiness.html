A paper by two economists from <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~blnchflr/papers/02_sjoe002.pdf">Dartmouth</a> says that frequency of sexual activity is more important to personal well-being than money.  
<br />
<br />About 60% of married people have sex at least once per week, a frequency which amounts to happiness to the tune of $50K per year of income.
