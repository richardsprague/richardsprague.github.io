<p>I remember the day long ago as a kid when I first became interested in Japan. This was back in the late 70’s, the US economy was in trouble, and US car companies were first starting to feel the beating at the hands of formidable Japanese competitors. Meanwhile, I had become interested in electronics, especially the newly invented PC, and it was natural to think that perhaps the Japanese would repeat the same success with computers.&#160; What if I could learn something about Japan, I thought? Wouldn’t that give me a huge advantage in preparing for the future?</p>  <p>So as soon as I got to college, I enrolled in two years of Japanese language instruction and after graduation I moved there, working as a new software developer at a subsidiary of the company that, at the time, had 90% market share in PCs.&#160; I spent a few years there before returning to the US for grad school, and then I was back again, this time working for Apple Computer.&#160; I stayed there for almost ten years, and continued returning reguarly until the year 2000, after which I haven’t been back since. Until now.</p>  <p>Now, almost 25 years later, I found myself back there again for a week’s vacation with my family.</p>  <p>This was my first week back in Japan in a long time.</p>
