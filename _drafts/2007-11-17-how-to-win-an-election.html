During the three weeks before the election, my site had about 1,000 completely unique visitors.  Here is a daily breakdown of just those who read my posts about the election.<br /><br /><a href="file:///Z:/Users/Richard%20Sprague/AppData/Roaming/Windows%20Live%20Writer/PostSupportingFiles/45e1353a-3abd-4744-9a02-e71dcd7e7505/image[5].png" atomicselection="true"></a> <a href="file:///Z:/Users/Richard%20Sprague/AppData/Roaming/Windows%20Live%20Writer/PostSupportingFiles/45e1353a-3abd-4744-9a02-e71dcd7e7505/image[5].png" atomicselection="true"></a><br /><br /><br /><br />Many of my brand new visitors came as a result of doing a Google search on "Maureen Judge":<br /><a href="file:///Z:/Users/Richard%20Sprague/AppData/Roaming/Windows%20Live%20Writer/PostSupportingFiles/45e1353a-3abd-4744-9a02-e71dcd7e7505/image[2].png" atomicselection="true"></a><br />Incidentally, these visitors spent more than 3 minutes each on my site, so I'm pretty sure they read my posts.<br /><br />  <br /><div></div>
