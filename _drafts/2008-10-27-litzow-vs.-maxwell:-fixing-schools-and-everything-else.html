<p></p>  <p>Somebody asked Marcie why her home district of Renton schools fare so poorly, and she replied with the reminder that Renton is not like Mercer Island.&#160; It’s a much bigger school district (100K students), with 44% of kids on government assisted lunch programs (in one school it’s as high as 73%).&#160; Top-down mandates like No Child Left Behind offer little flexibility, which crushes the options for resource-constrained schools.</p>  <p>There is no question that Marcie is more aware of the day-to-day realities of poor districts, and that her legislative priorities are more focused on the immediate needs of the have-nots.&#160; That’s why the Mercer Island School Board President says <a href="http://www.pnwlocalnews.com/east_king/mir/opinion/letters/31870134.html">Steve Litzow doesn’t get it</a>.</p>  <h4>&#160;</h4>  <p>Both candidates talk about how pro-environment they are, but Steve had more specifics, pointing out his work on behalf of electric cars on Mercer Island and more.&#160; Marcie suggested moving housing closer to work.</p>  <p>One more thing: everyone blames the rising cost of education on mandates, so one question to ask is where are those mandates coming from, are they really necessary, and who is more likely to reduce them.&#160; Marcie mentioned that we should reconsider some of those mandates (she specifically blames No Child Left Behind).&#160; Still, it seems to me that most (all?) of the mandates come from the “fairness” people like Marcie.&#160; Marcie would pay for that through even more funding, of course.&#160; I don’t necessarily disagree with that – I mean, I like “fairness” too – but everything in life is a tradeoff, and at some point you need to decide how important that is, and whether you’ll make much of a difference anyway.</p>  <h4>Tolling</h4>  <p>Both candidates are opposed to tolls on I-90, of course (what? are you surprised?), but give different reasons.&#160; Steve points out that the modeling of traffic volumes indicate that it’s unnecessary: tolling 520 doesn’t mean jams on 90.&#160; Marcie points to the unfairness of requiring tolls for off-island teachers or family members. </p>
