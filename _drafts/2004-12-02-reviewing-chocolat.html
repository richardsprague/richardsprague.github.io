<a href="http://www.catholicexchange.com/vm/index.asp?art_id=25660">Miramax�s <i>Chocolat</i>: Liberation Theology According to Mary Poppins</a>: "Imagine a movie about practicing Wiccans who live repressed and sour lives in a small village. Imagine these villagers being visited by a single Christian mom and her daughter who, by acts of charity and the subtle suggestion that the whole Wicca thing might not be so good for them, lead the wayward witches into an abundant new life. 
<br />
<br />Take another step. Make the village mainly Jewish and the mother-daughter duo Muslim. Paint the local Judaism as an obsolete religion begging for reformation, the Seder as an empty ritual, and the Star of David as an empty symbol. See the wussy rabbi cowering in the shadow of the zealous mayor, who�s a hypocrite.
<br />
<br />Can you picture these? 
<br />
<br />Exactly. These movies could never get made, thanks be to God. The former would be mocked as Pollyannaish, the latter roundly condemned as anti-Semitic, and rightly so. 
<br />
<br />Yet if you substitute �Wicca� and �Jewish� for Catholic you get the basic plot of Chocolat, directed by Lasse Halstrom and nominated for four Academy Awards in 2000. The movie�s lush art-house cinematography and earnest, bouyant acting almost manages to hide the bigotry of its makers. By Oscar time that year, the patina on the Miramax hopeful had worn off; the golden statuettes went to other nominees. "
