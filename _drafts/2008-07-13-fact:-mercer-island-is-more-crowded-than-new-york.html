<p>No wonder <a href="http://www.islandvision.org/">so many people are concerned about sustainability</a> on Mercer Island.&nbsp; Look at this fact:&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercer_Island%2C_Washington">Mercer Island has 3,452 people</a> per square mile.&nbsp; That means we pack more people into less space than <a href="http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/largest-cities-density-125.html">the following cities</a>:</p> <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="282" border="1"> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top" width="192">City</td> <td valign="top" width="88">People per square mile</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="189">New York</td> <td valign="top" width="88">2,050</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="187">San Francisco</td> <td valign="top" width="88">2,350</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="185">Los Angeles</td> <td valign="top" width="88">2,750</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="184">Kuala Lampur (Malaysia)</td> <td valign="top" width="88">2,750</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="183">Beirut (Lebanon)</td> <td valign="top" width="88">2,800</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="182">Nagoya (Japan)</td> <td valign="top" width="88">3,150</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>I am not making this up.&nbsp; Check the stats for yourself.</p> <p>Everyone knows that population growth is a serious problem, right?&nbsp; Species depletion, irreversible habitat loss, global warming--the unchecked greed of corporations and "globalization" is destroying our planet!&nbsp; Even at the local level, you see the problems creeping up on us right here on Mercer Island: <a href="http://mercerislandblogger.wordpress.com/2008/07/12/tent-city-on-mercer-island-not-suffering-from-lack-of-controversy/">homelessness</a>, and <a href="http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/06/chasing-relative-decline-in-mercer.html">our declining incomes relative</a> to the rest of the country.&nbsp; To reverse this we all need to do our part, right?</p> <p>I have a different theory.&nbsp; People who think the world is overpopulated are really saying it's overcrowded with the <em>wrong kind of people.</em>&nbsp; I don't care what the anti-population people think;&nbsp; Mercer Island is a wonderful place full of great natural beauty and resources that is mostly thanks to all the people who live here.&nbsp; Yes, we have a dense population</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>My favorite example is The Netherlands, one of the most densely-populated countries on earth.&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_density">At 395 sq/km,</a> it is more crowded than Japan (339), India (336), or China (138), yet it the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands#Agriculture_and_horticulture">world's 3rd largest exporter of food</a> (only the U.S. and France export more).</p>
