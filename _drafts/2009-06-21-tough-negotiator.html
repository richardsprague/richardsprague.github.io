<p>When the Chinese sued for peace in 1841 after losing badly in the Opium War, their negotiator reached an agreement with the British to (1) give up Hong Kong, (2) pay $6M in indemnities, and (3) allow direct contact with the Emperor. The terms were considered so onerous that the negotiator was ordered to be executed.</p>  <p>Meanwhile, the same thing happened on the British side, where the negotiator was fired for being too generous.&#160; Here’s the letter written from Lord Palmerston to Charles Elliot:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>You have disobeyed and neglected your instructions; you have deliberately abstained from employing, as you might have done, the force placed at your disposal; and you have without any sufficient necessity accepted terms which fall far short of those which you were instructed to obtain.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Whoa!&#160; As it happens, Palmerston was later censured by British Parliament for being too quick to start wars – a punishment that was quickly overturned when he won the next election.</p>
