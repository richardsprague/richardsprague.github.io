<p class="paragraph_style">I'm a long-time technology product builder who tends to become
overly obsessed about whatever I currently find interesting. For the past couple years
 that's been personal science and the Quantified Self, especially the human microbiome. Right now I am
  <a href="https://github.com/richardsprague/kombucha">doing analysis in R</a> and Python
 for over a year's worth of my own daily <a href="https://ubiome.com">uBiome</a> tests.

<p>

My past lives were spent in Japan (about a decade in Tokyo/Yokohama),
and another three years in Beijing China. I've worked at Apple (marketing),
 the Silicon Valley startup WebTV Networks (in business development), Microsoft (product
development) and elsewhere.

I grew up in rural Neillsville Wisconsin and was educated at Stanford and Wharton. My family
and I currently live near Seattle, on Mercer Island.
