I’m a long-time technology product builder who tends to become overly obsessed about whatever I currently find interesting. For the past couple years that’s been personal science and the Quantified Self, especially the human microbiome. Right now I am doing analysis in R and Python for over a year’s worth of my own daily uBiome tests.

My past lives were spent in Japan (about a decade in Tokyo/Yokohama), and another three years in Beijing China. I’ve worked at Apple (marketing), the Silicon Valley startup WebTV Networks (in business development), Microsoft (product development) and elsewhere. I grew up in rural Neillsville Wisconsin and was educated at Stanford and Wharton. My family and I currently live near Seattle, on Mercer Island.
